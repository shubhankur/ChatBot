User: Are you and your husband nearing graduation?
Bot: I have a year left, but he's double majoring and has three more to go.

User: Oh wow! Double majoring sounds like a lot of work. I have a minor, but mostly because I switched majors, but had only one class left for a minor.
Bot: I personally believe he is ray, oops I personally believe he is crazy, but he enjoys it.

User: hi there!
Bot: Hey! What's up?

User: Not much!  Just packing for a trip.  What about you?
Bot: I'm just layin around being lazy because I donated blood today haha Where are you going on your trip?

User: Oh that's awesome!  That's kind of funny because I just got called by red cross to donate blood :D And I leave tomorrow at 10:30 Can I ask your name?  It's not showing up on the chats
Bot: Ugh, they call me every day. I had to block the number because it was getting annoying And you can call me Julia. That's weird it isn't showing up on the chat Are you going anywhere fun?

User: Oh really?  I live in a small town, so we don't really have blood drives near me very often so they don't call too much. Ok.  Nice to meet you Julia! And I'm actually going up to lagoon for an orchestra competition!
Bot: Cool!! Do you play violin? And it's nice to meet you too Sophia

User: Yeah I actually do play violin! How did you guess?
Bot: Just lucky I guess. I was originally going to go for bass or cello How long have you been playing?

User: I have been playing for 12 years! do you play any instruments?
Bot: WOW that's awesome!! I used to play violin and cello in middle school but that was a long time ago haha I also played piano for like 8 years but I don't do that much anymore either

User: Thanks :)  And wow!  8 years on piano is super good.  I played that for a few years but got too busy. What year will you be at BYU this fall?
Bot: I'll be a freshman. What about you?

User: I'm going to be a freshman too!  Do you know where you are living yet?
Bot: That's awesome!! And unfortunately I am on the housing waiting list. I'll most likely have to live off campus

User: Oh man!  I'm sorry!  There are some really good off-campus places too, though I hear!
Bot: Yeah, I'm sure it will all work out. Where will you be staying?

User: I'm going to be living in Helaman Halls
Bot: Is that the one with the dorm rooms and the community bathrooms or does it have the apartment style rooms

User: Its got community bathrooms :/  I wanted the other, but it was full!
Bot: The dorms will be fun too!! I'm kind of excited about off campus though because I will cook my own food  haha

User: Yeah, that's what I've heard actually!  I'm actually glad except for the part where I had to buy a meal plan. Yeah, if I got to live in Heritage I would have been able to cook for myself and budget my money
Bot: Yeah, those meal plans sounded brutal. Isn't the cheapest one like $350 a month For like 12 meals a week

User: Yeah.  They're so expensive :/  Like I'm pretty sure I could budget my money and only spend $100 a month!
Bot: Same haha. I was thinking I can maybe even get to $50 a month if I go to Costco Idk, it'll be interesting. I'm planing on moving it this summer to practice living on my own. Plus I want some adventure haha Out*

User: True!  Costco is legit the best. I'm staying at home this summer, though, because I don't have anywhere to live in Provo before school starts
Bot: Ikr!! If there is ever an apocalypse, I will be hiding in Costco I was thinking of moving to Idaho. Provo roads scare me so I avaoidndriving in them at all costs haha

User: Really though! And Idaho?  Woah. Are you going to BYUI or BYU provo?
Bot: I'm going to Provo My grandparents have a big house and they can't climb stairs anymore so I was just going to take over the top half of the house

User: Oh ok!
Bot: Plus the singles ward there is great haha. Especially when all the cowboys get home forfeit college for the summer;)

User: That would be really cool actually.
Bot: From*

User: And yes, cowboys are the cutest :))
Bot: Have you seen the movie the longest ride?

User: Yes of course!  That is such a good movie!
Bot: Yes!! I love it so much. Plus the guy is super hot haha I'm a sucker for a good romance movie haha

User: Yes, that definitely always helps haha And have you ever seen pride and prejudice?!
Bot: YES!! All six hours of it!! Or is it four? I love regency romance so much Like "edenbrooke" is one of my favorite books ever

User: Yes!  I love it!  All time favorite movie actually! I'm a hopeless romantic! I don't think i've ever read edenbrooke though have you ever read pride and prejudice or sense and sensibility?
Bot: No, I've never gotten around to reason the books haha. Also, you would LOVE edenbrooke. It is amazing Also, have you seen austinland

User: Hi!
Bot: Hey! How is it going?

User: It's all good! How are you?
Bot: I am doing really well thanks for asking Are you just relaxing or doing anything fun today?

User: So I didn't sign up for a science topic but oh well! Do you know why BYU started this challenge?? Well I'm about to go to church in about 20mins and I'm actually flying back home tonight!
Bot: Oh that is exciting! Yeah real quick then BYU did this so they can get conversation data to help improve AI units to be more capable of conversation Rather than just one party talking the whole time

User: Oh okay! Sweet! How about you? What are you up to?
Bot: Yeah its pretty cool I am just spending the next few hours relaxing

User: Nice!
Bot: Yeah It is always nice to take a break I dont really ever take enough

User: For real! And yeah! Sometimes it's hard to find that balance but good for you! Treat yourself!
Bot: So what kinds of things do you like to do

User: Well I like to Latin dance, I love to just spend time with my family, I love art. Just like to try new things all the time. You?
Bot: No way, basicallly the same What kind of latin dance? Like samba rumba and cha cha or like salsa

User: Like bachata, cumbia, merengue
Bot: Oh okay so more club style latin dancing? Those are fun

User: Yeah! Love it! What got you into it?
Bot: I just like dancing, its fun to do and my family does a lot of dancing so it carries

User: Same! And what type of dancing do you like?
Bot: My favorite to do is to go with friends and country swing But I also like ballroom

User: I've always wanted to try ballroom! And if never really tried country dancing. One day I should though!
Bot: Definitely There are so many clubs and stuff that you can try country swing at And then ballroom is fun to take one of the classes in

User: True! I will have to do that! Well, I have to head out. It was great chatting with you! Have a great day!
Bot: Okay It was good talking to you Enjoy your evening

User: I would spend my time learning new skills that could lead to advancements in technology that could help the world.
Bot: oof, that was a really good answer. The first thing that came to mind for me was traveling and learning more instruments while I can

User: I would also be finally able to finish all my video games that I never started. I've always wanted to play an instrument.
Bot: haha I would wanna become a beast at super mario kart but what have you wanted to play?

User: Piano, guitar, and violin. I used to play the saxophone in middle school but it just wasn't for me. Any instrument that you gotta blow into is to much for me.
Bot: ahhh i get you. i never played a "band" instrument. seems pretty difficult. ive only learned only ones that I can sing with.

User: What instruments do you currently know?
Bot: mostly ukulele, a little guitar, and a litttttle piano. mainly just chords

User: After I saw the movie "Kubo and the two strings" I wanted to buy that instrument. I think it's called a sitar. It only has 3 strings.
Bot: ohhhh, i havent watched that yet. but ive heard good things haha

User: I was researching the cost. That instrument is pretty pricy. So I haven't gotten one yet. I tend to buy before I am even ready so if I still want to do it I'll probably look I to trying it out first before investing money into it.
Bot: oooo smart move. i bet if you set like an hour or two a week you could learn on youtube thats how i learned my instruments tbh

User: Do you know of any places that has instruments to rent. So you said you play Mario kart. Do you have any game systems?
Bot: ohhh! in the byu library

User: Hi there! My secret superpower is memorizing names quickly. What's yours?
Bot: Being able to sense where a bathroom is located at all times I am horrible at remembering names! alright, thanks for chatting

User: Oh ths one is super easy Definitely Roast beef on a sunday after 1 PM church and youre starving. That is officially the best smell ever I don't think you know how to smell
Bot: hey locksmith

User: how's it going haha
Bot: I remember you telling me that yesterday haha

User: small world
Bot: you are consistent with that smell haha

User: we will just get paired forever haha it is in fact the best smell and i will never change What are you up to today?
Bot: Oh you know just the same old routine work and this Im currently waiting for my girlfriend to get ready to go

User: of course haha
Bot: what about you?

User: im at work but there is nothing to do sooooooo yep
Bot: what do you do? I think you might have told me but I don't remember

User: im a web developer at the law school
Bot: ahhh how long have you been doing that?

User: since the beginning of last semester so like 4 months almost
Bot: how do you like it so far?

User: oh it is actually the best job on campus
Bot: oh really? how so?

User: it is good work in my field, it pays well, and a lot of the time we aren't ever really busy also how come your username isn't on the leader board?
Bot: I just have a different name from my netID keep it anonymous you know?

User: oh right just realized that hahaha well you must be retty high up there yea that makes sense
Bot: yeah Im in the top 10 haha are you?

User: almost. i am a little below it, but im sure i will be top 5 by the end of the day hahaha gotta get that laptop.
Bot: hahahaha yeah man that laptop is a huge incentive what do language do you guys use at your work?

User: php primarily. it's not the preferred choice, but it isn't the worst.
Bot: ahhh i used a lot of php I used .php for my databases project files

User: smart. I think I'd prefer ruby but I guess it is just a bit slower
Bot: ahh ruby I don't know ruby that well but its very popular

User: It is really nice to use. If i did do web development I'd be using Ruby on Rails. You can do some awesome stuff with it.
Bot: I'm not familiar with Ruby on Rails and its capabilities do you have an example of what it can do?

User: it is really high level. for example instead of writing out a loop you can literally write -> iterations x {instructions} like 5 x print(Hello)
Bot: what

User: i know
Bot: are you serious lollll where have I been

User: Crazy right? there's a lot of weird little things it can do that condense your amount of coding to a very small amount
Bot: that is insane! C++ is death

User: Agreed. Not the biggest fan, but I guess we need it for something haha like most coding jobs
Bot: yeah for sure Do you want to do web development as a career?

User: no I would rather run a software consulting business. Much more interesting to me.
Bot: ooooh an aspiring CEO thats awesome. What kind of consulting or software would you do?

User: one day haha and I think I want to work with just small businesses and just provide whatever they might need.
Bot: So you guys don't really have any projects going on at the Law School huh?

User: the only thing that i have to do is watch some videos on web dev with wordpess but i am already pretty familiar with it.
Bot: oh I remember when I got paid to watch videos to learn haha Do you guys have any UX designers that you work with?

User: not that i know of haha just this web developer mark that they recently hired
Bot: ahhh do you feel like you guys need a UX guys in the team why or why not?

User: meh not really. lawyers don't need anything too fancy and we all have the ability to make the site look as people want it mostly because they don't want much. they would mostly like just a very simple straightforward website you know?
Bot: thats fair enough simplicity is beautiful

User: agreed. So yea we don't really need any fancy designers i mean if they came at cost, why turn them down though?
Bot: true Im a UX designer and its interesting to see what different developer's opinions are

User: oh solid. Don't get me wrong, you can do things i won't ever be able to do, but lawyers don't ask much of us haha
Bot: hahahaha exactly. Its what the user and the consumer wants

User: Hello
Bot: Hey there

User: How are you doing?
Bot: Good! You?

User: Very good
Bot: Genial :P Cachaco

User: If my computer asked me to not turn it off, I would probably freak out.
Bot: Oh hey how are you ember?

User: Doing pretty decently. You?
Bot: i am doing well it is getting late and i am getting a little tired

User: I feel that. I sort of feel like I've run into a brick wall of energy depletion.
Bot: yeah

User: Which is sort of weird, since I normally stay up much later than this.
Bot: yeah me too what is it with today? It must be the position of the moon

User: What is the position of the moon?
Bot: thats a good question but i am sure it has something to do with me being tired right now ok! :)

User: Ah, gotcha. Waning Gibbous... Energy is Waning... Makes sense to me.
Bot: yeah that has to be it if you could travel one place in the world this summer where would you go and why?

User: So... I would love to go to Scandinavia, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark... Also Iceland and England... Because I've always wanted to go to England. But... in reality I am going to North Carolina and Arizona!
Bot: do you have family there or is it somewhere you just want to see?

User: Visiting family.
Bot: I have always wanted to go to england

User: Same! And Ireland.
Bot: wait you would go to ireland and not england or do you mean that you would go see them both at the same time?

User: Both. Definitely both.
Bot: i have some irish heritage it would be cool to go there i have always wanted to see the uk they have the best accents in the whole world! Where is the furthest you have gone traveling?

User: Uh... Well, I served my mission in Sweden. Lived in China and Switzerland for a while with my family.
Bot: Oh wow that is really cool

User: How about you?
Bot: I went to sweden for a big scout event once I have also been to spain and canada but that is pretty much it unless you count landing and taking off from denmark when i went to sweden

User: Really? Where in Sweden? Spain... Ah, I want to go to Spain too... I've heard it's beautiful there.
Bot: rinkaby sweden spain is succcchhhh an amazing country

User: Why were you in Spain?
Bot: my sister served her mission there and we had a foreign exchange student we were visiting at the same time so it was like a mission trip and a foreign exchange catch up visit at the same time we got to see all of the really good sights all over the place and we even got to stay at their grandparents hous house it was really fun

User: Nice, way to kill two mynocks with one blaster shot.
Bot: woah wait a second what in the world is a mynock?

User: Uh... It's a creature in Star Wars. (Empire Strikes Back, the creatures that are living inside the Monster that they fly in to... I'm a bit of a Star Wars nerd)
Bot: ohhh that makes more sense i didnt even know what those were called what is your favorite star wars movie?

User: Ah... I don't know that I have an answer for that. Probably three, four, or six.
Bot: wait how are you ordering them?

User: Prequels are 1-3, Originals are 4-6, and Sequels are 7-9.
Bot: oh ok what are the sequels again? i thought there were only 2

User: There are only two, for now, but there is going to be a third, so that they'll have three trilogies.
Bot: oh interesting do you know what is will be called? I havent heard about it at all

User: No, I haven't heard anything about it either... It should be... interesting.
Bot: are you the daring type? like have you ever done anything or gone cliff jumping?

User: Uh, so I did technically jump off a cliff once. But I have no clue how I got the nerve up to do that, because normally I'm not at ALL daring.
Bot: did you die?

User: Strangely enough, no, I did not. Although that'd be kind of cool. You'd be talking to a ghost if I had.
Bot: hahaha sorry bad question i guess cliff jumping gives you so much adrenaline

User: It was terrifying. I'm NOT a fan of heights. I take it you like it though?
Bot: yeah i went once and it was a blast it took me forever to work up the courage to jump though

User: Where did you go?
Bot: i went to a place down by las vegas i dont remember what it is called probably near lake mead that is for certain but not were everyone normally goes boating it was like all off on its own

User: Huh, I don't really know that area. Is it a place a lot of people go to cliff jump?
Bot: umm i don't think so but there is a good amount but i doubt it is famous for cliff jumping are you a swimmer at all?

User: Not really.
Bot: oh do you do any sports?

User: I've almost drowned too many times. I ran cross country for a while, did Tennis too...
Bot: oh my that is really bad

User: But I'm not super good at that.
Bot: did you ever take swimming lessons?

User: No... It wasn't really a priority in my family.
Bot: oh ok we did it in my family which doesnt really make sense considering we lived in a desert but it was a good experience and definitely a good skill to have

User: Yeah, I wish my family had done it. I don't need to be terrified of the water, but it's kind of too late for that now.
Bot: can you swim now?

User: I can not drown...
Bot: well that works i mean that is swimming for the most part :)

User: This is true.
Bot: then you learn to float and then you learn to float and flail and then you start to move and you are swimming voila!

User: I'm probably actually at the floating and flailing point.
Bot: well thats good then you can move just do it for a long time and you will get where you need to go sorry haha

User: All good!
Bot: what is your favorite pastime?

User: Writing.
Bot: wow what drives you to do that? More importantly when did you start and what made you decide to even do it?

User: I used to think that everyone thought the way that I did. With too many stories and characters taking up all the space in my head... I just really like getting them out on paper.
Bot: oh interesting I am the same way but with music not characters

User: Do you write music?
Bot: that is way cooler in my opinion just a bit i wrote a short piece last semester That was before i knew it was ok to copy some of the styles or beat patterns used by other artists

User: That's way cool. I have always thought people who can write music are super awesome!
Bot: so i tried to make it really original

User: Is it something you are going to keep doing? I imagine that made it difficult.
Bot: yeah i will probably keep doing it i want to keep writing that song where i left off

User: That's way cool.
Bot: each time i sit down i get more inspiration and it sounds better and better

User: You should definitely finish it. That's kind of how it is writing. I love watching my stories develop. It is so satisfying.
Bot: the funny thing is that though i can write music, i am still terrible at writing words i got way better at it when i kept all my journals on my mission but i am still not the best at it

User: So you've got the music, not the lyrics?
Bot: i was good enough to get an A in my wrtg 150 class but that took A LOT of effort no no lyrics it is just a piano song

User: You play piano?
Bot: yeah and i sing

User: So you sing, write music, and play piano.
Bot: yeah look at that

User: That is quite the trifecta.
Bot: man of many talents, a jack of all trades what can i say ;) i dont usually do piano that often to be honest it is just every once in a while, but i took lessons like my entire life

User: That's way cool. My mom taught me the basics growing up, but never very serious lessons.
Bot: i bet that was fun, was she a good teacher?

User: She was very patient.
Bot: i like to think i am patient with my siblings when i teach them things

User: That's always a good skill... I can be super patient with lots of people with most things... But sometimes I'm a little more terse than I should be.
Bot: i am really calm

User: Haha, no one would ever describe me as calm.
Bot: really what are you?

User: Slightly eccentric, a little bit weird, and easily distracted.
Bot: oh we are twins! maybe minus the eccentric honestly i have to look that up to see if it really describes me accurately or not

User: Unconventional and slightly strange.
Bot: oh that is just another word for weird then yeah hahaha

User: Man I'd get really fat
Bot: Well, you don't need to eat it!  What whould happen to all those allergic people?

User: that would be a serious disaster
Bot: And is it chunky peanut butter, or creamy?

User: hopefully creamy because I personally think chunky is nasty although, I'm pretty sure we'd all get sick on PB real fast anyways, how's class going for you today?
Bot: Haha, I don't have class until 1, so...pretty good?  How would you rate the absence of something anyway?

User: Dang, I'll be done with classes by the time you start, but I guess i'm a bit of a morning person. What do you mean by the absence of something?
Bot: Well, if I haven't had class, how would I rate it? I'm also a morning person, but I do all my homework in the morning.  That's just how my classes landed.

User: oh I get what you mean, you couldn't really rate it then. I guess a better question would be how is your day going? Are you in the middle of midterms? Do you have a pretty heavy workload right now?
Bot: So far so good.  I have a bit of a stuffy nose and stuff, but that's fine.  I have had all my midterms by now, and I feel like I did okay, despite not studying enough. But I do have two projects right now...one I have 3/4 done and due friday, the other a reasearch paper that isn't due for a while....0%.

User: Hi how are you?
Bot: heyyyy whats up adam how was your move back

User: Not much What up with you? My move was fine I had a good weekend
Bot: oh no way where to?

User: He got called to cote d'ivoire French speaking
Bot: wowwwww

User: Pretty much a third world country but not bad for africa
Bot: that is a great call

User: He might have issues with anxiety so I am hoping he will still do fine How has your week gone? Anything exciting?
Bot: Yeah man I heard back from Pluralsight and I made it to my final interviews

User: sweet what is plural sight
Bot: have you heard of Lynda? lynda.com

User: no actually what is it?
Bot: it has video courses for all kinds of technology topics they are pretty good actually

User: oh interesting how does it relate to plural sight? I have never heard of the, them.
Bot: pluralsight is more prestigous and more exclusive

User: so what does it teach about
Bot: it teaches everything computers and other things you sign up for courses

User: ok
Bot: whats the temp like in St. Geezy

User: It was pretty cool Where my parents are at it is sprinkling a little bit and it may snow tomorrow from what I hear Where are you from again?
Bot: Provo originaly from South korea tho

Bot: I lived till I was about 9 years old then moved to Provo

User: wow where do you prefer of the two?
Bot: USA USA USAAAA haha

User: Why hahahaha
Bot: but I grew up hear mostly so I call this home

User: So what do you think is the most exciting thing happening in the world right now?
Bot: I think we jsut had a great event in NOrth and South korea ending the Korean war

User: Yeah that is huge I am glad it is happening it seems to be all over the news
Bot: yeah who knows maybe we will get missionaries there soon

User: do we not currently have missionaries in south korea?
Bot: we do but not in north

User: Oh yeah that is true Do you think missionaries will ever be allowed into the north?
Bot: we Koreans never thought there would be peace

User: Yeah it is super crazt crazy I wonder what changed
Bot: yeah right? those north koreans might have some weird motive i hope not tho I hope its all good

User: yeah maybe they have some plan to infiltrate the south and begin the war anew That would be horrific
Bot: yeah hope not

User: Every semester I read through one or two of my syllabuses And I think to myself.... what did I get myself into
Bot: yesss I feel you Im so happy I have one more year of that

User: Yeah you are almost done right?
Bot: yep one more year

User: So do you have the rest of the day free?
Bot: Yes!! It's great

User: That's wonderful. I guess there's only like a day or two left for the challenge What's your goal to end up with?
Bot: I don't really have one. Just as far as I can get Do you have one?

User: Goal is to get 5th I think haha
Bot: Nice! Are you close?

User: I've got a bit to go I think it may only be doable if I can like share long stories haha
Bot: Okay Do you want to share one with me? I've helped the number two guy do that

User: Haha sure that would be great!
Bot: Alright. Shoot

User: Adam told you what kind of stories? I just have to think. Like I'm not good at fiction and coming up with random stuff
Bot: Like I suggested an embarrassing moment. But, he couldn't bring himself to share it It just ended up being chatting

User: Ahh haha alright. Well I can give a little summary of my life I guess
Bot: Okay

User: That could take up quite a bit I think Alright here goes So I was born and raised in St. George, Utah. I only moved once across town when I was like 7 and going into second grade. We moved into a much nicer house The only other move I've made is going to college so that was something that was different for me. I'm the oldest out of 4 children
Bot: I had one. A purple dragon How many did you have?

User: Haha nice. I had quite a few. I know I had a large leopard and a smaller leopard. As well as an elephant, a black poodle, an arctic fox, and a normal red fox And a labrador
Bot: So were you one of those obsessed children with them?

User: And a cat Haha I mean I don't think I was totally obsessed but maybe pretty close
Bot: Cool You can continue (sorry for the questions)

User: No this is good haha I started it. You know what else I really loved? Tamagotchi's! I had probably 4-6 of them
Bot: What are those?

User: Oh my goodness you don't know?!
Bot: Nope Or may be I just don't know them by the name

User: Dang. Well, they were little electronic devices where you took care of like a little virtual animal thing. I guess maybe you could relate it to pokemon
Bot: Ohhhhh! Now I do I had a littlest pet shop one

User: Ohh yeah. I think those were a little different but definitely the same idea. They were like $15 or something weren't they? Back in the day when we had those instead of cell phones haha
Bot: Maybe... Yeah haha

User: I wonder if they are even like still sold haha
Bot: Probably not

User: I looked it up apparently target is selling them
Bot: Really? Do you remember the bakugon things?

User: Were those the like tops?
Bot: You throw them on their cards and the ball pops open to reveal an animal

User: Oh yeah! they were balls, like transformers kinda right?
Bot: Yep. All the boys at my school were into them

User: Oh my goodness this is making me miss my childhood Now all kids play with is their phones basically Quite sad if you think about it
Bot: I know. It feels like yesterday but it was years ago I had a club house in the woods No phone

User: A club house like that you built? Like a tree house?
Bot: More like a fort out of sticks

User: Gotcha Hmm what were some other toys Barbies I guess, littlest pet shops we kinda already mentioned
Bot: The paper stars Or claws

User: Oh yeah
Bot: I never learned how to make them

User: There were those little bracelets that were in the shapes of like animals that was a big thing for a while as well
Bot: Yeah. There was always that one kid covered from hand to elbow on both arms

User: It was like a contest to compare how many you had on your arm Haha yess
Bot: I can't think of anymore You can keep going with your life story

User: Okay. That was a fun little reflect back moment :) So there was the four of us. But in high school, one of my friends ended up getting on the dance team, so she was totally busy with that and became close with her dance friends
Bot: Awh

User: My other two friends I started to not exactly feel as comfortable around. They hung out with immature boys and some rather inappropriate jokes I was younger than them, so when they got their licenses and started driving to lunch, because of the rule that you can't drive anyone besides family for 6 months I couldn't g go So we drifted apart that way and I made friends who were a little better influences
Bot: Good. I've had to do that

User: Yeah it can be hard. One of the girls I've actually been seeing in my YSA ward so we might actually hang out again sometime this week after like 5 years haha She's waiting for a missionary now and plans on getting married in september
Bot: Ooo! Exciting

User: Alright break from that story now haha. Do you have any good/funny/embarrassing date stories?
Bot: So I'm an incoming freshman. I have this odd texting story

User: Great let's hear it Right so have you dated much?
Bot: It was this guy from my stake who was friends with guys at my branch.

User: I didn't really until I got to college. Just went to a couple of the dances is all
Bot: Not really. Only been on dates with this one guy

User: okay
Bot: Our branch is small So, this guy anyway. He waved to me over messenger I waved back to be polite and he struck up a conversation It was okay at first. Than he started mentioning he was going on this camp out. And he talked about pranks that guys do

User: Mmm Oh gosh
Bot: He was like if that happened to him. He'd have to run out in a towel Well, he asked what I would do if I come upon him like that.... I was like go have another guy get you clothes. He said he'd be too embarrassed and just wanted me to get them That I could even get some of my clothes for him

User: Hahaha some of the situations guys come up with...
Bot: Than he starts talking about maybe him getting a dress. I'm like dude I don't really want to talk about this He kept going. Like would I want to see him in a dress I'm like NO

User: Strange
Bot: It's kept going and going from like mentioning skinny dipping. I tried avoiding him and ended up blocking him He sent me a photo of him in a dress even after that So that's my story

User: Dang. How long ago was that? He must be one of those guys that just likes to wear dresses... which is weird. Well I tried out the dating app thing for a bit. I think I had a guy send me a picture of him in a dress as well one time
Bot: What's with that? I think I might avoid those apps

User: Yeah...I mean honestly I never really expected to find or get anything from them. But I thought it was kinda fun to chat to people Like this
Bot: I think they should keep this up It's really fun

User: Yeah. Cuz at the end it will be sad to end it and never really know who you were talking to that whole time
Bot: I know! I've had a couple guys give me their instas tho

User: Some people on campus though I know have met up at the library Yeah. I know someone who has gotten user names for things Which if you just say the user name I think it counts as personally identifying information
Bot: Maybe they can change the rules after the challenge I asked about the usernames and they said it's fine just not all the time

User: We shall see haha. I made up a kinda code with someone in order to get their snapchat so it wasn't flat out said haha Which made it fun as well
Bot: Oh really? I thought maybe you could like capitalize or add numbers in each bubble

User: Yeah. I mean he came up with things like half of w not you but... and square root of 9 but in letter form
Bot: Haha! Those are clever

User: But there were a couple that were difficult that I didn't quite get So I just started saying things that begun with the letter like jaguar and elephant
Bot: Um, what does that mean?

User: Like jaguar for j
Bot: Ohhh I got it

User: Yeah Want to know one of my dating app stories? Or maybe two haha I've only ever met up with two
Bot: Yeah

User: And they were strange so I was like, "Never again"
Bot: These sound like they'll be good

User: So I mean they were both mormon. The first guy I had had really good conversations with him over the app. And he said his dad worked for BYU. I think his job was like security security guard or something But anyway we decided to meet up on BYU campus So it was like evening and he called me and then we found each other. He said he had something he wanted to show me back in his car
Bot: Uh oh

User: So we walked to his car and sitting in the back seat was a gun.. But then he just kinda jokingly said something like, "I brought this in case you were some creepy person" and in my mind I'm like uhh I'm the girl here!
Bot: Hahaha! But really?

User: So after a while I found out he was just like super into guns and knives and explosions and stuff. He told me about some stuff he had to do for his job And showed me youtube videos of a guy he liked blowing things up He was also SUPER tall
Bot: Not too bad now.....?

User: He was a nice guy. So we did actually meet up a second time But like he just talked the whole time about guns and such which i'm not all that interested in. I don't recall him like even asking me any questions
Bot: Oh, so he was looking for someone to share that love of guns

User: So I'm a pretty good listener, but after a bit of that I just felt frustrated because he never let me speak Yeah. I'm like totally against them really
Bot: Not good. I hate when they just go on

User: So that's the first guy
Bot: Is the second worse? Or just funny?

User: I'll let you be the judge of that haha
Bot: Okay

User: So the second. We talked over the app, got numbers, and even talked on the phone a few times He was like the most...I don't know, energetic person ever. Always super cheerful And over the phone he was funny. But he was doing like army training or was in the army or something
Bot: Hmmm

User: But he was home for a bit last may in salt lake. And i was still at BYU for spring semester So we tried to figure out a time to meet. He loved to play tennis so he wanted to meet up and do that. But he wanted me to drive to salt lake. And I wasn't sure that was the best idea by myself I didn't want to drive up there just for that reason
Bot: Odd

User: But I had a friend from high school, a guy I liked. And he happened to be up one weekend so he took me out on a date. And then the next day was when I was planning on meeting on meeting this other guy So the guy from high school we did a double date with his cousin and did an escape room and went to dinner so it was a lot of fun. Then he invited me to go to the utah hogle zoo the next day with them as well
Bot: Oh, yeah. But good that you got people who go with you

User: So I drove up with the guy I knew, and then he was kinda asking what i had going on later in salt lake so I sorta told him I had another date And I think he got it out of me that I hadn't met this guy before so it was sorta embarrassing haha
Bot: Haha Sounds very good embarrassing

User: Anyway so after the zoo he left in his cousins car and I went to go meet up with this other guy
Bot: (Not good sorry )

User: We went to a pretty nice park and played tennis for a while and went for a short walk. But it wasn't very long And then after I don't know i guess I got the feeling he didn't like me because he's like, "Well, is there anything else I can do for you?" And acting like he was ready to be done and leave
Bot: Really?! Rude

User: But I was still interested in spending more time with him...so I like asked him a question and we struck up more conversation And then he's just kinda not afraid to say things so he asked me like why I was so quiet because I'm real shy around those I don't know well And he was also telling me a bunch of things about army training and started doing some of the stretch workouts they do
Bot: Was that weird that he started doing them for you?

User: So I kinda did. I like made him run around a tree and back. I don't know, guess he wanted to show his strength haha
Bot: Oh, haha

User: And then he wanted me to like do situps or something and i'm like, eh I'm okay And then later he calmed down and got out of me that I hadn't ever kissed anybody And I told him it's like hard for me to open up Then he like scooted me closer to him and put my arm around his neck and his hand around my waist and asked me if it was weird
Bot: Oh, no!

User: And I was like, um yeah sorta, I mean I only officially met you today And then he like tried to get me to kiss him. I had always kinda had like a fear of kissing haha
Bot: It's understandable. Especially in that situation

User: Yeah. And I'm like uh no this is definitely not happening with some guy who I'm likely to never see again Who I met today But he like pulled me in and I dropped my face like into his chest. And he's like, "You know all you have to do is lift your head" And I was stubborn and wouldn't of course
Bot: Good

User: So yeah. And then it was getting late like dinner time so he asked if I wanted to go get dinner So I said sure so got in his car and went to dinner and then drove back to the park by my car And by that time my phone was almost dead and I didn't have a charger in my car, and I knew I would need it to get back home and find my way out of salt lake haha. So he had a charger in his car. And said we could just sit for a while and listen to music until it was more fully charged
Bot: Did he do anything else weird?

User: So he played some music and started singing along and grabbed my hand and asked it that was weird. And again I was like yeah so sorta But I don't know it in a way it was kinda fun to just get a little more comfortable to sing along haha then finally I'm like alright looks like my phone is good so I can start heading home. I think it was about 10 at night
Bot: Uhhhhh

User: And I was like no...you don't. See ya haha
Bot: Yes! That's great hahaha

User: Haha so yeah. But like just over texting he was so energetic and stuff like over the top haha
Bot: Almost like he was trying to look good

User: I still don't know what to think of him really I mean we kept texting a bit after that and he acted the same
Bot: How long ago was that?

User: Last may
Bot: Fun fun Those were quite some stories Not bad though

User: yeah. Haha I'm looking back through some of my texts with that guy He's said we totally need to meet up again That was like thanksgiving
Bot: Did you just end up ignoring him?

User: Not really...I don't like to be mean haha And like I said I still don't even know what to thik think Like he was weird but cool
Bot: That's good. I've heard of some guys who were just mean

User: Yeah So there's those stories!
Bot: They were good Is it helping your word count?

User: Word count? I don't even know what that counts. Does it count every single word or just new words?
Bot: I don't know. I thought it was counting every word you typed?

User: Maybe. I mean there's the score and then the number of words and chats and turns So I don't know if all those things matter
Bot: Yeah, I haven't really paid attention to all that

User: yeah. Well my laptop is about to die so I'm thinking I should take a break and get ready haha. Will you still be on? In like a half hour I'll probably be back
Bot: Mmm, I don't know Probabaly not though Sorry. It's been fun chatting with you! Good luck on your placement!

User: Okay no problem. Yeah thanks you as well! Think I'll run into you again and I can go on more on my story haha?
Bot: Maybe! Hahaha, if we do you can

User: Hello?
Bot: yeah how are ya

User: just got home haha
Bot: hahaha what were you doing again before hand?

User: I was a work if you weren't doing ACME what else would you do something totally unrelated
Bot: neuroscience assuming I had to switch fields

User: what would you do with neuroscience? I had a dream to become a neurosurgeon
Bot: I would like to be a neurosurgeon but more like on my own time and hours

User: yeah they are really busy they make great money though
Bot: yeah they do but why not make the same money but not kill your family relationships in the process you know what I mean? who knows maybe we can develop a robot neurosurgeon

User: yeah I know what you mean family life seems very important to you
Bot: yeah

User: me too
Bot: It is more or less an end goal and a means to an end too but for now it is an end goal

User: thats the reason why we exists here on earth right? besides learning as much as possible its to have a family That is God's plan
Bot: yeah that is the way I see it But it is not really that easy haha

User: but if we take out the spiritual factor and just think of biological we want to have children and pass down our genes yeah true I can't wait to start a family but at the same time it will be hard I don't think anyone can really prepare for a family except maybe financially
Bot: yeah that is true

User: how many kids would you want to have?
Bot: probably like 3-4

User: 3 for me is also probably how many id like what gender would you want for your first child?
Bot: male probably

User: why is that?
Bot: I don't know

User: I think I'd want a girl first.
Bot: why do you think so?

User: I'd spoil her like crazy I think i'd be hard on boys I'd definitely want boys for sure though in my family tree
Bot: I don't know maybe you have convinced me that girls are the way to go haha I will be sure to choose a girl for the first one

User: haha would you choose a gender if you could?
Bot: yeah

User: would you genetically modify your children if you could?
Bot: I totally would maybe not genetically modify them but If I could choose the order I would

User: you wouldn't choose eye color or what they would look like?
Bot: Oh I would want to but I wouldn't be ok with modifying their genes to get there Maybe by choosing the gametes but not by modification Hey I am going to call it a night! It was nice talking with you!

User: i passed my classes what about you? oh also I got together again with my girlfriend her name is kendall
Bot: Wow I'm sure she's a lucky girl haha

User: that's a code name
Bot: That's cool I respect that

User: thanks
Bot: Best thing that happened to me you ask? I don't know

User: yea
Bot: Maybe it hasn't happened yet [?]

User: marriage?????????
Bot: yes

User: I work with children with special needs. Mostly with kids with autism and down syndrome.
Bot: Right now Seattle is building shelters for homeless people that include nice clothes and showers and stuff so people can go to job interviews and have a fighting chance. Oh, that's super cool!

User: Thanks, yeah I do love them. They are incredible people, once you get to know them. They just want to be understood. But also so cool about Seattle! That is encouraging to hear.
Bot: I think that everyone wants to be understood, and I'm glad you're taking the time to help people who have a harder time to do that! I want to go into clinical psychology so that I can do the same!

User: If I were to give a TED talk it might be about teddy bears
Bot: I love TED talks! I would talk about overcoming fear. What would you talk about? I'm Kyle by the way, what's your name?

User: The Greatest Showman
Bot: I really liked Black Panther The Greatest Showman was really good too Although I didn't like how it wasn't very historically accurate

User: I haven't seen Black Panther. I didn't like how the "Opera" sing didn't sing opera And the actress didn't actually sing either
Bot: I highly recommend it. I'm not a huge Marvel fan but it was a good movie just by itself. And yes that was so annoying too, like she was just singing pop but they kept calling her an opera singer. The music is really catchy but the story wasn't that well planned out in my opinion.

User: Yeah, I can see that. Even if the story was still the same, I think it would have been a lot better with Jeremy Jordan rather than Zac Efron
Bot: I could see that being true also. I just feel bad for PT Barnum's actual dependents. Like the story of their ancestor got completely trashed. He wasn't actually as sketch of a guy as they painted him out to be in the movie.

User: That is a sad thought :( If you were a crayon, what color would you be?
Bot: It is sad...like if someone makes a movie about me I don't want them to say I cheated on my wife when I actually didn't...it's super lame! I would be blue. A light blue probably.

User: Why light blue?
Bot: Blue is my favorite color, and sky blue is a pretty awesome shade of blue. What about you?

User: I'd probably be green. It's not my favorite color, but it's fun, refreshing, and calm Both a warm and cold color Thrilling and tranquil
Bot: That makes sense It's a very interesting color for sure Like it reminds me of a calming walk through a park So pretty much the sky and the trees are the two best colors

User: Exactly!
Bot: Wait I didn't know you could use emojis on this! My mind is blown

User:
Bot: That is way too funny I mean I guess technically I never actually tried but still It also doesn't help that I'm on my computer right now which doesn't have emojis But usually I use my phone which does obviously

User: Gosh darn it :/ well I guess you'll just have to wait
Bot: I guess so, but now I know!!! Thanks for making my day with emojis! So what are you up to today? Anything interesting going on?

User: Nothing interesting. I'm going to babysit in about an hour. Tomorrow I'm going to a wedding reception for a person I don't know. An evening full of strangers is always fun
Bot: Wow there's nothing like hanging out with lots of strangers! That sounds like fun though. Wedding receptions always have good food so there's that.

User: Free food! Woot!
Bot: Yes!!!! That's the best kind of food!

User: But the real deal breaker is the music
Bot: Oh yeah, that's true. But free food! I mean having to talk to strangers isn't much fun. But free food!

User: If I'm going to be stuck eating with a bunch of strangers, the least they could have is good music.  But yeah, free food!
Bot: That's true for sure. But free food! Haha, how did you end up with an invite anyway?

User: My stepdad's co-worker is getting married But I don't know the guy
Bot: Oh I see, makes sense then. But free food!

User:
Bot: Free food is a serious business! Everytime they have free J Dawgs in front of the Wilk the line is like 2 miles long

User: J Dawgs? The Wilk? I don't know what that is... Is it a Utah thing? Oh wait! John Bytheway had a song about it! "RMs and freshmen are making connections"
Bot: Ha sorry, J Dawgs is a hot dog place and the Wilk is the student center. There's like twelve million abbreviations for things around here I guess!

User: I've visited once before, but I've never heard of J Dawgs. Wilk for Wilkinson, right?  Any other important abbreviations I should know before I go to BYU? Not all 12 million of course
Bot: The restaurant is just south of campus if you ever want to check it out. I think all the students like it because it's very affordable. And yes that is correct, Wilk for Wilkinson. Well all the buildings have abbreviations which takes a while to get down but it's not too bad. Are you coming here in the fall?

User: Yeah Incoming freshman
Bot: Oh awesome, I'm sure you'll enjoy it! Do you know what you want to study yet? I'm a Marketing Management major and I really enjoy it so far!

User: Yeah I'm going into Art Education K-12 to teach art in elementary schools
Bot: Oh cool, that sounds really interesting! Is that always what you have wanted to do?

User: Not always. I used to want to be a veterinarian (like any little girl) until I found out that I'd have to put animals down. Then I wanted to be a film director Until I realized I didn't have the patience for it from directing plays at my school
Bot: Wow that is an interesting progression actually!

User: But I'm really passionate about this path and know it's truly the one for me
Bot: Makes sense, it sounds like fun!

User: What's your dream job?
Bot: Way back when, I wanted to be an architect but in like 3rd grade I changed my mind to computer specialist because I loved working on computers. But then when I was in junior high I started selling stuff online and got pretty good at it so I changed my mind to business/marketing specialist. I still work for BYU 's technology department though so I didn't lose that dream

User: Cool beans! How long have you been at BYU?
Bot: Yep! I've been here for a year. And I like it so far!

User: Good to hear
Bot: Yep, I'm glad to have the summer to take a break now though! It's really nice going home from work and having no homework to worry about and stress over!!

User: true. Kudos to those people who can plow through, but I would never be able to put myself through that
Bot: Same, so same! There is no way on planet earth that I could go to school year around here. I would probably go completely crazy or something! Two semesters at a time is plenty enough for me!

User: Amen. Two semesters is hard enough with anxiety and Dyslexia
Bot: True story, I also struggle with anxiety and it's not fun but totally possible to make it though it! I've found that most of my professors here have been really understanding.

User: That's nice to know. I'm always scared that a professor might not be Anxiety sucks. But all you can do is keep moving forward Like it says in Meet the Robinsons! Wow, it's been forever since I've seen that movie What's your fondest childhood memory?
Bot: Yep that is so true! I love that movie! Sorry I had to go run and do something so that's why I just disappeared for a few minutes!

User: It's all good What was your favorite childhood movie, then?
Bot: Thanks I would have to say that my favorite childhood memory was Toy Story I could really relate to that movie because I had a few favorite toys that were my world so I guess I just connected really well with the main characters.

User:  cool. My favorite movie whan I was 4 was The Last Unicorn
Bot: Haha wow that sounds like s pretty interesting movie also!

User: Every time my family would go to blockbuster, I'd always get that. I knew EXACTLY where it was, and if it wasn't there, I'd cry. After that it was Brother Bear
Bot: That's so funny actually! Wow I remember when movie rental stores were a thing! They definitely are not anymore though!

User: Sadly, no. Redbox is slowly fading away as well. Physical copies of movies aren't as popular with Amazon and such
Bot: That's true, like even Redbox isn't as popular now. Between all the streaming services and being able to rent movies on your TV for just a few dollars it's just so much easier online I guess.

User: Everything is online now. Maybe if the internet we're to stop, Blockbuster would come back! I'd be okay with that
Bot: Wait you're right Why aren't the blockbuster people trying to destroy the internet is the real question Then everyone would love Blockbuster once again!

User: I know! I'll gladly volunteer for that rebellion! Block-bus-ter! Block-bus-ter!
Bot: Ha it's the plot to bring back Blockbuster! Wow did we just officially start a social movement on this thing? I'm dying laughing over here now.

User: Bet you wish you had a laughing emoji
Bot: I do wish I had the laughing emoji!! This is so unfair, why don't desktop computers have an emoji keyboard option?

User: XD works
Bot: That's true. That's how they did it before emojis were invented I guess... XD

User: Well that's too bad because we're going to destroy the internet before they create emojis for keyboards
Bot: Wow that's so true though, then we won't need emojis anymore because people will just have to start using their actual faces to express emotions again!

User: It's like a reverse evolution!
Bot: Wow, it will be the disintegration of the internet. Life as we know it will revert back to the 1970s basically. I've never thought about it but we always talk about how our world would fall apart if the internet stopped working but actually it wouldn't, we'd just be back to where we were 40 or 50 years ago.

User: Yeah, that actually sounds a lot better than the present Sorry, if I don't respond for a while, it's cuz I'm babysitting And the baby is getting into stuff he shouldn't
Bot: It would be pretty interesting, and thus we would have Blockbuster again! It's all good, I have to leave pretty soon actually. Wow that sounds like a major challenge. Little kids are super funny

User: Yeah the 3 year old just asked if I was my mom's mom.... And he called me bacon instead of Meighan
Bot: Wow that's funny! Seems like a pretty legit nickname to me!

User: Not when you hate bacon
Bot: Oh I see, that must be a struggle then. Even Turkey bacon?

User: Even turkey bacon Any other turkey is delicious though. Any meat that comes from a pig tastes gross. Except sausage
Bot: Oh okay got it So the fact that this kid is calling you "Bacon" is incredibly ironic then it sounds like!

User: Yeah, cuz Bacon sounds similar to Meighan... Kinda Plus he loves all things food.
Bot: Ha it kind of does surprisingly! So he's an avid food fanatic it sounds like!

User: His favorite food is fruit
Bot: Wow that is a very interesting food. I like fruit too! We would be friends I'm sure! Casually dying laughing over here!

User:  you guys bonding over food  And no emojis to show for it Sorry, I keep rubbing that in your face. I find it funny that you didn't know that before
Bot: It's true, the only thing better than fruit in my opinion would be free fruit! And true story, I have really learned a lot today I think...

User: Free food! You learn something new every day
Bot: Free food! Well my shift ended at work so I have to go, but thanks so much for talking! It was a pleasure!

User: Same! It was great talking to you :)
Bot: Have a great evening!

User: I think if the world was made of peanut butter it would be a big mess. Everything would get stuck together
Bot: My brother in law would also die

User: But I mean then again you would always have peanut butter to eat. You could wake up and lick the floor that might be nice. Uh oh...is he allergic to peanuts or something?
Bot: only if nobody had walked on it umm, no he just hates all nuts

User: True. Otherwise it would pull off the nasty stuff from your shoes. Really? That's too bad I really like nuts! Are you a fan?
Bot: I love nuts!

User: Me too! What's your favorite kinds?
Bot: I really like cashews, but dependent upon the day my favorites shift

User: Those are really yummy! I personally love almonds and cashews as well. Especially the ones you can get at fairs that are roasted and covered in sugar! Have you had those?
Bot: YES!!! Those are so good especially with a cup of warm coaco!

User: Yes they are so good! I have to be in the right mood to have cocoa sometimes it makes my mouth dry! Haha So what makes you want to do this BYU chit chat challenge? Is the the prizes they have that you can win
Bot: I get it! I think I correlate cocoa with it because I used to go to Cornbellys during the falls and I always see them in winter/Christmas specials. I have a friend who told me about it and I thought it would be fun Plus if I did win anything, It would just be super cool How about you?

User: Cornell belly's! I've heard that place is really cool but I've never been there! I'm sure coco would be nice on a cold day! Um so I just got a random email about it and was reading through it. I think it's be cool to win an iPad or computer too! I see some of the kids that take notes on iPads and it looks real sweet! I'd love to have one so I could do that! Haha
Bot: Was it the one from about a week ago, or have they sent out a new one? I think it's pretty nifty as well!

User: Yeah it was the one about a week ago! I haven't gotten an other emails or updates from them recently though. Have you? Yeah super cool! So what classes are you taking this semester?
Bot: No, I have not. I was just curios because I know they did the drawing for the macbook pro yesterday. I'm not sure when the Ipad deadline is. Oh mostly music and stem based classes, how about you?

User: Oh really they did?! Do you know if they announced a winner or anything? Or where you could see it!m? I'd love a new MacBook too hahah Oh awesome. What are stem based classes? This semester I'm taking a lot of science classes like o chem and anatomy! And also a religion class! Those are fun
Bot: I have no idea how to check to see who won the Macbook, however one needed to get over 500,000 points by yesterday to even be put within the raffle. A stem based class is anything that has to do with math or science Anatomy is killer, best of luck in there!

User: Oh gotcha I think I made th cut hopefully! For the raffle at least! Oh that sounds really cool! Is that why your major is something in science? Those sound interesting! Thanks! So far anatomy has been pretty great it's probably my favorite class!
Bot: I haven't picked a major yet, I just like to do too many things! I'm really glad you like anatomy! You can learn some really crazy and cool stuff in that class! Are you also doing the cadaver labs?

User: Well that's better than not being interested in anything! Do you have an idea of a career or anything you'd like to do? Yeah I've learned so much things already it's crazy how complex the human body is. There is so much little stuff that all works together to make it all function. Yeah I get to go to the cadaver lab twice a week! have you taken anatomy?
Bot: I haven't really gotten an idea on what I want to do with the rest of my life.  There was a time when I wanted to major in physics, but my last semester was really off putting I agree the human body is very very complex! My favorite word from anatomy is gomphosis I've never tooken anatomy, and I doubt I ever could. My sister did and she loved it despite the formaldehyde. I am personally too weak stomached for that sort of thing

User: Man I took a physics class my first semester and it was probably one of the hardest classes I've ever taken! Ah yes gomphosis that's a type of joint I think if I remember correctly for your tooth? Haha The smell is pretty hard to deal with at first but ive kind of gotten used to it over time! And it is pretty intense looking at a cadaver for the first time!
Bot: I personally like life related physics( why the sky is blue, colors, harmonics, buoyancy) over Newtonian. It is really hard to remember things like the coefficient of friction or kinetic vs potential energy. It is so much harder to visualize. The further one gets into the program the more fun it can be! you're completely spot on on the gomphosis, just remember if you don't eat enough vitamin C your teeth will fall out That's fantastic to know that you are getting so much knowledge with the human body! Are you planning to become a medical personal?

User: That's right! I think vitamin C deficiency is called scurvy or something like that! But yes I agree with the physics. Applicable physics is way more interesting! I especially liked when we talked about how they designed cars and the brakes and things like that   More of the everyday things!
Bot: Pirates would get scurvy if they ran out of organges, so I think you are right again there

User: Yeah that's the plan. I would love to go to medical school and specialize in orthopedic surgery! I fee like that reall speaks to me! You're right! You seem to know quite a lot about this kind of stuff too!
Bot: Only because I live with my sister, she is going into speech pathology! I hear lots of crazy cool stuff from her! By the way, this chat has been super awesome, but I actually need to go! Thanks so much for conversing with me!!

User: Hello, hello!
Bot: Hey! How's your day been?

User: Oh, hi! A real person! My day's been pretty good, actually. I've just been working on a personal project of mine.
Bot: Yeah? Anything exciting?

User: No midterms to worry about, no homework, so all the time in the world for it. And, yes! Some fun things. I've run into some of the weirdest compiling problems.
Bot: Wow that sounds so nice. I've been pretty swamped with midterms unfortunately.

User: Ugh, I'm sorry. Which classes?
Bot: World Civ. Marketing Management. and Spanish. Not too exciting. But tell me more about your project.

User: (Ooof. Good luck with those!) It's nothing too ambitious. Or . . . I thought it wasn't, at least. Have you heard of Zork? That old game from the eighties or something?
Bot: mmm I can't say that I have...but give me a sec and I'll google it

User: Okay! It should tell you that it's a simple text-based game. And it really is simple. No graphics, no interface, no nothing. Just a place to insert text and then various descriptions and fonts that reply to you.
Bot: yeah, okay. seems pretty neat

User: That's what I thought, too. I was like, "Hey! That's pretty simple. I'm sure I could make my own version of that." So I opened up good ol' Visual Studio, opened up my first file, and got to work. . . . actually, I did quite a bit of designing beforehand, but then I got to work.
Bot: Wow, that's impressive. So have you ever done something like that before?

User: Haha, no, never. Unless you count the computer science classes I've taken? Oh, that reminds me! Which major are you studying?
Bot: I'm doing generals right now, but I'm hoping to study Commercial Music!

User: Whoa, really? Like, the getting into the music program and stuff?
Bot: Yeah, it's really exciting stuff.  Pretty competitive though. What about you? Anything with computers? Or is that just a hobby?

User: Computer science is my major, actually. But I talk about that all the time with people on here. I'd guess a good majority are either majoring or minoring in it. Tell me about music! It sounds amazing. I don't know how some people have the aptitude for it.
Bot: Haha, yeah I've noticed that too. Lots of CS, but that's cool. Music is my passion. I've been writing music since I was little (but I'm still not very good at it). I don't really specialize in any one genre or instrument though. I've just kind of messed around with a lot of things. So we'll see where it takes me.

User: Wait, wait, what? You've composed music? That's incredible! Does that mean you know music theory and all that jazz? Can you play jazz, actually?
Bot: Haha, yeah I can't say I've ever gone out of my way to listen to filk music before, but maybe I'll have to sometime. But I'm not very fluent in music theory. I have a basic knowledge, but a long ways to go. Most of my writing happens on the guitar or piano so it's just one instrument. Nothin g fancy.

User: Sounds pretty fancy to me. I'd love to listen to one of your arrangements some time. Honestly, I think that people who have that talent should be praised and lauded. It almost scares me how insane people are with music around here.
Bot: Really? I would have thought it'd be more popular. But hey- as long as you enjoy it, that's what matters, right? But yeah there are SOOO many talented musicians at BYU It blows my mind.

User: Is there a reason for that?
Bot: I think it may just be a mormon (or I guess I should say Latter Day Saint) family thing. Like, all of us grew up taking piano lessons or singing in choir or something, ya know?

User: You know, that probably DOES play a big part in it, doesn't it? Let me tell you, with the amount of people who are as talented as you, I don't think I'd like all the constant fighting for spots. It's not that I don't think I could do it. I probably DO have it in me, somewhere, assuming I was ambitious enough to tackle it.
Bot: It kind of stresses me out, to be honest.

User: Yeah. It would me. How do you deal with it?
Bot: Well, since I'm preparing to apply still, I'm focusing on trying to be different. Have a different approach or something different to offer. Just be myself. I'm sure they've s een 1000 of the piano prodigy's that can write a decent melody. So I'm going to just put all of me out there and hope it's good enough. Because if it's not then maybe I should be somewhere else haha

User: That would stress me to no ends. It's kinda like that in computer science, though to a lesser degree. When you're out trying to get jobs, every body has been through the classes you have. What marks you as different is all the, um, different stuff you've done.
Bot: I believe it! Are you close to applying for jobs right now? Wait, really! That's insane

User: Heh, no way. I'm leaving on a mission soon so there's no real point in getting internships. But double yes to the "insane" part. People my age have already had three summer internships. People my age are getting paid $35/hour to work in jobs.
Bot: Wowzers. I get paid 8.50. Holy moly.

User: I know. It's staring in the face of that and feeling, "Oh, my goodness, I haven't done enough."
Bot: But hey, a mission! That's exciting!

User: Hehe, yes, a mission.
Bot: I know we're not supposed to talk about church things on here technically, but I'm also 19 and working on mission papers, so we're kind of in the same boat!

User: Oh, hey, really! I'm assuming by the name of "Kaylie" that you're a girl?
Bot: Haha, yes, I guess I need to figure out how to change my nickname to something more ambiguous

User: Maybe just Kay? Or K? XD Be like me, I suppose.
Bot: Haha, yeah. Any idea how to change it?

User: I think you'd have to contact the chitchat administrators. Shouldn't be too big of a deal, I don't think.
Bot: oh okay. Last round it was something different. Not sure what happened

User: But, in case you were curious, I'm a girl, too, hence why I'm nineteen and not left on a mission. Yeah, I know! They changed the rules a bit. I think they're trying to make it more anonymous or something?
Bot: Probably. Makes sense. So is this your first or second year at BYU then?

User: Second year. But I'm not technically enrolled in classes at the moment. I thought I would get my mission call before finals, so I didn't enroll. Which, of course, means that I don't get called until February. Funny how things work out, isn't it?
Bot: Very true. At least you have some time to prepare though. So you have your call, or not yet?

User: I do, I do. I received it back in September. Apparently, leaving in five months is a little out of the ordinary, but I'm okay with it. And I'm grateful for the time to prepare. It's a little strange not being in school while the rest of my classmates are off progressing themselves, I'll admit.
Bot: Well, I'm sure you'll get there. And I'm sure that everyone else is looking at you and thinking the same thing. We're our worst critics. So we can't be too hard on ourselves But, where are you serving??

User: Heh, thanks. Down in South America. It's a placed called Bahia Blanca in Argentina. I'd never heard of it, but it's a nice, long area right along the coast. Lots of beaches!
Bot: Congrats! That's exciting. Beaches are great. Ugh, winters aren't though. dang it.

User: I'm kinda excited, actually! I was worried I was going to be sent somewhere agonizingly hot, so having some cool weather isn't the worst thing. My hair's gonna get all frizzy. But, hey, what do you do?
Bot: haha yeah, my best friend is on a mission in Mexico right now, and she said her hair took a while to get used to the humidity. But it's all worth it

User: Oh, I haven't asked yet. Is there a reason you stopped by and wanted to chat? Just taking a break from studying before diving back into the fray? Because I haven't seen you on here yet. It's not too crazy; there are a lot of people. But I've been here enough that I thought I recognized most everyone.
Bot: Yeah kind of. I'm trying to make flash cards for Spanish while I do this. So far it's working pretty good actually.

User: Oh, wait, really? Hehe, that's so funny! I'm semi-fluent in Spanish.
Bot: Oh, are you the person with 2 million points then? haha

User: I wish. I'm competing with him. We were tied yesterday.
Bot: But yay for Spanish! I'm in 101. so not too impressive. But I'm learning so But that's awesome. You go for that prize. All the way

User: Man, I'd love to quiz youi! Hehe, thanks. I don't want to flood their servers with Spanish words, though. Seems just a little cruel considering it's an English chatbot.
Bot: Hahaha that would definitely throw them for a loop. So what exactly are they trying to create with this? Just a chatting software?

User: I'm not perfectly certain. I know they're creating a social bot named Eve, and I think the goal is to have her be able to communicate in a real conversation for at least - 20 minutes. I read it somewhere I feel, but I couldn't say where. They originally scoured the internet for chains and threads, mostly from Reddit, but Eve came back fluent in swearing and flaming others. They didn't want that in a bot.
Bot: That's hillarious. But they came to the right place then. Is it created by students? Sorry I'm asking all these questions. I just don't know much about it. I heard about it through my marketing class actually.

User: No, no, questions are great! I love them. Wait, did you really? How did that happen? "Here's a place to chat. Go chat. It's worth it."
Bot: A representative came in right before class and advertised about it. Probably just trying to get as many people involved as possible.

User: I'd imagine. It's an ambitious project. I don't know what you know about artificial intelligence, but it takes a lot of data. Like a lot. Meta data. Maybe you've dealt with it in marketing?
Bot: Yeah, that's got to be a tough job. Do they create a software to sort through it all?

User: I haven't the slightest. I'd imagine they would. I know large corpora have come about to help parse data, but I can't even fathom how difficult it must be to sort through it all. English itself is a complicated language. People who are learning it admit that.
Bot: Luckily they seem to know what they're doing. Hey well it's been great talking to you! I've actually got to head off now, but good luck with your mission and everything:)

User: Okay! You, too! I loved talking.
Bot: :)

User: Hello!
Bot: Hello! I think the last film that left an impression on me was a Russian/French film about a Russian ballerina that moves tonFrance to learn contemporary dance. Having lived In Russian, and knowing many ballerlinias, watching one break free of such a strick world to find herself was motivational!

User: Oh did they show that in the international theater?
Bot: It did! I believe it showed in March. Have you ever watched a movie in the international cinema?

User: I went to one, and I was going to go to that one too but I had to finish a code
Bot: I believe you can find it online.i think I saw it on either amazon or Netflix. I recommend it. Are you a computer science major. Sorry, that was supposed to be a questoin mark at the end.

User: I will have to look it up, what was the name of it? I am not, I just wanted to learn more about programming and coding in general I thought it would be useful knowledge to have in the long run
Bot: It is called Polina. That is wise. In th future, coding is going to become necessary ni practically every job it feels like! I have an aunt that is a nurse, but she went back To school for a masters in computer science to work in a higher position at the hoepitwl. Hospital. What do you want to major in?

User: I definitely agree I am doing Industrial Design
Bot: That's neat! Does that involve any coding or computer skills to do?

User: It can be rendering on a computer
Bot: Do you have an idea of what you want to do with it for a career? Where you would like to work for instance?

User: I think working for Tesla or Apple or any company like that would be incredible I am pretty open minded though with where it can take me you hear all the stories of people who dont do anything really like their major so that could happen too
Bot: My husband is obsessed with both Tesla and Apple, so I approve of those choices. Do you have any idea for products you would like to produce? That is also true. You never know where you will go until you get there!

User: Well definitely a car, that would be incredible My whole life I was drawing designs for cars
Bot: That reminds me of my cousins! They did that, too! I would try, but it would not even resemble a square with wheels, more like... I actually do not know what it resembled. Wha T kind of cars are you interested in designing?

User: I think it would be great designing new electric cars and models like that Just to be on the team to design the next new tesla would be so awesome
Bot: That is neat! I believe there is a team no campus that designs cars, but I think that is more along the lines of race cars. Would you be interested in working with them Sometime to help design their cars?

User: Yeah that would be incredible I think I  have seen some of their work They test out on the salt flats
Bot: that Would be a fun project:) I think one of their cars in in the book store here no campus.

User: Oh I think I have seen that Its right by the stairwell
Bot: Correct! Behind the candy counter. You see it as you are walking towards the store where they sell food. (Not the cougareat, but the snack like food).

User: I thought it was so cool, I stopped and looked at it a bunch I loved pinewood derby growing up I would always take it so seriously
Bot: I do not have any brothers, but I remember my cousins talking about it. They would also take it seriously. My grandpa owns a ca business and my uncle runs a car show in las Vegas. My other uncles travel around the country looking st car shows. I was never super interested, but I can now proudly tell the difference between a Nissan and a Toyota Mainly because my husband thought it would be easier to play games in the car if I actually new what type of car I was describing instead of explaining them as that one white One that we saw. Do you think you would be interested in joining up with the racing team this next semester?

User: HAHAHA It took me so long to get past the color or "truck, not truck" description of cars It might be fun, do you know what specs they look for Or qualificaitons
Bot: It is so hard to tell them apart! Do you mean for the racing team? I am not sure. I went in to interview them for an assignment (I used to be a journalism major) and they seem To be quite chill. I would imagine you need to know about engineering a bit and also you might have to take a few classes. If you go in and talk to them, they could help you Know how to join! I just googled it. They have a form that you can fill out saying you are interested in joining. Just google Byu race car and a link will pop up with a link to their website.

User: I learned today that some Citroen cars can be driven on only three wheels.
Bot: That's pretty cool

User: It was on Charles de Gaulle's Wikipedia page, haha
Bot: I dont even know what citroen cars are? It seems like a really cool word though

User: It saved him from being killed during an assassination attempt! Citroen is a French brand of cars.
Bot: Who is Charles?

User: Perhaps better written as Citroen, perhaps?
Bot: Im guessing he is a french man

User: Indeed. He was the President of France at the time.
Bot: Thats good that is saved him from assasination Oh, that makes sense. God save the King!

User: Yeah, something took out one of the wheels but the car could still be driven away from the danger. What about you? Is there something interesting you've learned today?
Bot: Well.. Thats a great question. I am in the computer science major and I am in a class right now We are learning about assembly and all that jaz jazz It seems really hard though, I just find it difficult to be able to follow all the lines of code.

User: Hello!
Bot: hiya! :D how's your saturday going?

User: Its going well! I had lunch with my grandparents today
Bot: oh how nice! where'd you eat?

User: My grandpa likes dennys so we went there
Bot: niice, i love dennys haha though usually all i get there is like hash browns lol

User: I had a good burger there, it was the bourbon bacon burger
Bot: ooh, that sounds super yummy

User: It was great, you should try it sometime Any fun things planned for the weekend? or just finals prep?
Bot: just finals lol, i actually just got home from doing all my fun things that i took the reading day for hahah how about you?

User: Oh nice I just had lunch, and that was it for fun Now in like a few minutes when I get the energy I am going to go take an exam
Bot: ooh, good luck!! what class?

User: american heritage thanks
Bot: ahh that's a hard one

User: have you taken it before?
Bot: i did this semester, i'm waiting til monday to take my final lol need just a lil more time to study

User: Thats not a bad thing
Bot: hopefully we'll both do well on it! :D

User: Cheers to that!
Bot: what professor did you have for it?

User: I have Dr. Madsen
Bot: oh neat me too! what time??

User: I was assigned to 12, but I went to different lectures depending on my schedule for the day and how it all worked out...
Bot: ah i see, that's super cool. i was at 12 too haha, but i was pretty much always there except for days when i just didn't go lol

User: I think I only missed one day of class? well maybe just a part of me
Bot: oh wow, that's impressive

User: There is an innate part of me that cant stand missing things Its like a primal instinct haha
Bot: haha that's a pretty good instinct to have

User: So what kinds of things do you like to do?
Bot: hmm, i love writing mostly I'm working on a couple different fantasy/scifi stories right now that take up most of my time lol

User: Oh way cool! What inspires you?
Bot: tons of things lol, lots of different shows and movies i watch, things that i see happen in real life. i try to do a lot of people-watching some of my inspirations are pretty weird though tbh, one of my works in progress is actually loosely inspired by the teletubbies lol

User: People watching can be fun, college campus' are great places for it That is cool though Its great that anything could inspire you
Bot: yeah, it's pretty fun haha what about you? what do you like to do?

User: I like to do art, and hike dancing is fun
Bot: ooh absolutely! what kind of art do you do?

User: Photography and drawing usually
Bot: that's awesome, i wish i could draw better lol

User: Honestly its just patience and practice. I start things that look like a 2 year old could do better But if I keep trying they usually turn out Then there are other times, but we dont speak of those times
Bot: hahaha yeah, someday i hope i'll have more time to give it more patience and practice lol hey, maybe over summer break i'll try focusing on getting better at drawing :D

User: You never know! You could be the next big artist But hey it was good talking I am going to go and take my exam now! I hope you enjoy the rest of your day
Bot: you too!! good luck again on your test!!

User: I like a lot of smells.  the smell of pizza is pretty good!!
Bot: hey whats up!

User: Oh hey!! double chats haha
Bot: haha hey you still there? hello? ?

User: I've got to leave but I'll come on later
Bot: ok

User: the world would be obese like the people in america
Bot: oh yeah it would I dont really like peanut butter anyway do you?

User: a little bit yeah i like making peanut butter banana sandwiches so good
Bot: would we be made of peanut butter too? oh yeah those are good

User: no just the world people would eat each other that's weird
Bot: ok thats good otherwise we might have some cannibalism going on haha

User: so how does this thing work lol
Bot: we talke

User: about?
Bot: and then the algorith looks at our converation and if it was long and interesting it gives us a good score to match how well we did about anything but no personal info like last names or numbers or emails or what not

User: ohhh okay haha this is interesting well hello
Bot: that is against the rules since this will be released as open source data how are you? Did you hear about this in the email as well?

User: i'm super tired haha just got home from work yessss i did how are you?
Bot: I am doing quite well have you heard about space x?

User: no what is that?
Bot: nooo you havent? what kind of a world do we live in? space x is like the new nasa nasa pays space x to send their sattelites to space

User: so explain what it is
Bot: it is basically a company that plans to take people to mars in the next decade and they are succeeding it is crazy they are building the largest rocket ever built

User: that's pretty awesome
Bot: they are built and designed by the company and elon musk is their ceo

User: weird i haven't heard about it
Bot: have you heard of elon musk?

User: what the heck is that lol
Bot: you havent? He is the ceo of tesla the car manufacturer he is a billionaire

User: oh wow that's interesting he's very idk the word lol
Bot: you should look it up sometime busy?

User: right now? i think i'm going to facetime with my friend
Bot: ho ok

User: what're you up to
Bot: i am talking with you then i am going to do a little homework then go to bed

User: so you're going to byu?
Bot: yeah i am majoring in acme

User: you go there now or will you be a freshman
Bot: i am doing spring semester i went there last couple semesters

User: ohhh okay that's pretty cool how do you like it?
Bot: i like it a lot actually

User: yo who dis?
Bot: death to those allergic and meeee

User: hey my chat is buggy and i can't see what i'm saying or what youre saying im gonna refresh
Bot: k

User: I would use it to skip traffic. Can imagine the face on the people stuck in traffic when you zoom by them?
Bot: If I had a flying car I would turn it into a time machine like in Back to the Future.

User: That is one of my favorite movies!! Would you rather have a car that could fly or a car that could time travel?
Bot: It is one of the best movies around in my opinion.

User: I agree one hundred percent.
Bot: Definitely one that could time travel. Way cooler than flying, but it could also be problematic I guess.

User: Why would it be problematic?
Bot: Just, as we see from many different science fiction stories, there can be tons of problems involved with time travel. New timelines, weird side effects, and other stuff.

User: Oh I understand. Breaking the space-time continuum isn't the smartest thing to do If there were no adverse consequences, what would you do with a time machine?
Bot: I think I would go back to experience cool events in history.

User: Like which ones? Ones important to you or ones important to the history of the world? Take your time it's an interesting question
Bot: Definitely ones important to history. I would love to see something like the roman Colosseum in its prime or even the building of the Egyptian pyramids or great wall of China. There are so many cool things like that I would love to see. What would you do with the same scenario?

User: Oh you're right!! There are so many interesting historical events that no one alive has ever witnessed That's an interesting question There are different reasons to want to go back Some people want to go back in time in order to change the present, and that doesn't seem like the smartest thing to do because it can have adverse consequences.
Bot: So what would you do?

User: But for me, I see a time machine as a tool. Obviously it's foolish to go back and change moments in history because that would hurt the present, but what if we could go back And we could uncover mysteries?
Bot: Like learn about things that we have no knowledge about in the modern day?

User: Imagine going back in time and witnessing the John F. Kennedy assassination. After witnessing it there would no longer be controversy or conspiracy Or that!! Imagine going back in time and witnessing, as you said, how they build the pyramids, because that's knowledge that we don't have today Does my answer make sense?
Bot: Yes definitely! But in order for people to not have conspiracies about it or something then I think everyone would have to witness it instead of just one or two people.

User: You know what? I never thought about that What if there was a justifiable way to record it or have a way to document it?
Bot: People in our time aren't very trusting of other people so it would be hard to convince them. But yes if there was a way to document it then maybe it would work.

User: And even if we had this ability for the whole world to know the "real" past, would it help society, or would it cause more confusion? Because I think you're right, there would be a lot of controversy over the legitimacy of the "recording".
Bot: That's a good question as well! I would hope that it would help us as a society but I guess we don't really know unless we experience it.

User: Yeah I guess you're right. It's really hard to know how new technologies will affect future society. If time travel were possible, do you think it would be legal?
Bot: Exactly. I only think it would be illegal if, and only if, it had the ability to change the present. If not, I don't see a reason to restrict it. But maybe the government would have a different opinion since they might have stuff to hide.

User: Oooooo now that's a good conspiracy What if there was no time travel but instead time witnessing?
Bot: So like a T.V. or something that plays history?

User: Imagine being able to travel back and watch history, much like Dumbledore's pensive in Harry Potter Less like a TV, and more like a virtual reality experience. Does that make sense?
Bot: Yes that makes sense. I think that would be really cool!

User: Imagine history class with those capabilities
Bot: History might finally be an interesting subject.

User: Imagine strapping into a headset and experiencing the Greek Forum or the first Continental Congress? It would completely change the way in which we learn and interact with the past
Bot: That truly would be one of the most amazing things.

User: I mentioned Harry Potter a while back. Are you a fan of Harry Potter?
Bot: And if it was publicly available, and trustworthy, I think it could help solve a lot of disputes or problems.

User: Oh absolutely It would solve most court proceedings, arguments, and change history
Bot: I'm a huge fan of Harry Potter! I've read all of the books quite a few times actually.

User: Wait Before we get to Harry Potter, would this technology be an invasion of privacy?
Bot: It might be for sure. There would maybe need to be some rules or restrictions on it's uses.

User: Imagine if someone could go back and see everything you've ever done? It would change our laws on privacy and the way we go about accusing people of crimes.
Bot: I don't think I would like that to be honest.

User: I don't think that anybody would to be totally honest Taylor It would be a little scary
Bot: Especially in this age of privacy issues; it brings up some interesting problems and questions.

User: Much like 1984 where everything you do and say is being watched
Bot: And yes it definitely would be a lot scary. A true dystopian world.

User: Honestly yes So tell me about Harry Potter Why do you like it so much?
Bot: I just feel like it is such a well thought out and intriguing world. Lots of amazing characters who are believable and lovable.

User: Are you more invested in the world or the characters?
Bot: I think a balance of both. The world is only as good as the characters and vice versa. So both of them are so well done and balanced, which is why it's one of my favorites.

User: That's interesting because as I asked it I realized that I didn't realize what my answer would be. So let's split this up. What is so great about the characters? What is different about Harry, Ron, and Hermione that you don't see in other popular franchises like Star Wars?
Bot: Well I don't know that it is exactly something this story has that others don't. Just something it does well. I have to go now though, but thank you for the intriguing conversation! Have a great day!

User: Love, Simon
Bot: Life is beautiful Well it's actually called la vita e bella

User: I LOVE THAT MOVIE!!!!
Bot: Me too!!! How was love Simon i haven't gotten a chance to watch it yet

User: Buongiorno Principessa!
Bot: :D

User: Love, Simon is so amazing! But at the same time really dumb... It's hard to explain but I definitely recommend it
Bot: Okay haha I'll have to check it out

User: How did you come to find La Vita E Bella?
Bot: World history

User: Cool! I watched it in my Italian class
Bot: So what are your interests?

User: I love to sketch, I love theater and movies. What about you?
Bot: I do volleyball, track, and swim team. I also love singing and playing the piano

User: That's cool! What's your favorite kind of music to play?
Bot: All kinds

User: Thats an amazing talent that you can share. I wish I could play the piano, but my hands are too small :/
Bot: I have little hands too lol i just have to modify or drop notes I can't play the guitar though

User: Yeah, trying to play guitar is a nightmare! Reaching across the neck is just out of the picture for these stubby fingers
Bot: Same

User: When I was little, my dad was learning to play and I always wanted him to play "Puff the Magic Dragon" nothing else.
Bot: Nice

User: Then he got me a Hannah Montana guitar and I learned 3 courds before I gave up... How has your day been?
Bot: Long not gonna lie

User: Hello!
Bot: hello1 Hey, whats up? I was just talking to you earlier. Hows your day been so far>

User: I think by the time when human develops light speed travel, we will be able to live outer space in inhabitable planet.
Bot: ?

User: Oh have we chatted before?
Bot: It seems like it. I remember your name from earlier... its cool though, I like it. Light travel would be pretty crazy Your probably right about living in another place that right now none of us would see livable

User: Although I feel like it's a plausible theory, but we're far from traveling in light speed.
Bot: No kidding, I feel like its already hard enough to travel the speed that we are Gas prices are just so high that it makes it really hard to travel as is

User: Data transfer is already light speed but transferring living object with molecules? I don't know..
Bot: Oh, man, thats a great point. I didn't think about transferring data

User: There is a very famous but controversial question about space traveling.
Bot: There are a ton of things that are being transferred all the time. I wonder all the time about how the internet is just going to get faster What is it?

User: It's about a "teleporting". The question is, "If the teleporting device dissembles you into smallest molecules and reassemble you at the location, Are you still YOU?"
Bot: Oh ya, I have heard a little about that.

User: Because even though the substance would be the same, but your whole body structure will be dissembled and reassembled.
Bot: It stems off the question of how we perceive ourselves. Do we see ourselves as molecules, because if they rearranged it would be different Oh, oops I just read the above one and realized I just repeated it. Haha Are you taking any science classes? These theories are often confusing, but I really like learning more and more about them

User: I'm really interested in human psychology and philosophical questions. But I'm not brave enough to study it risking my grade haha. Are you interested in any of those fields?
Bot: Haha. Ya, no kidding, a lot of it can get really deep I think they are cool, but just like you, not really my type of studies

User: I like how this program gives us a good starting question. I wonder where they brought up all these interesting questions.
Bot: I don't know if I told you this already, but I really like Animation and am in the computer science field I know some of them are really creative, like this one. I have never really thought about what would happen after we hit the point of reaching the speed of light The hardest part for me in these fields is the fact that does anyone really know how some of the theories were done. After all they are theories. If we absolutely knew about something it wouldn't be a theory, but rather a law. Like Newtons Laws

User: Yeah we never know until we actually reach that point of technology and find out.
Bot: But theories, like space-time continuum and creation through the Big Bang, are just really hard to digest, mainly cause we don't have evidence of them. They could be true, but also they may not be... who knows, you know?

User: When I think of the history, one of the concern is that the light speed technology can be also militarized and become a galactic weapon.
Bot: Oh man, that could be pretty crazy it would be like Star Wars! I just hope, that I'm solo!

User: Oh are you also a fan of StarWars movies? I guessed it from your reaction about it and I think you mentioned you like playing Starcraft on previous chat
Bot: Ya, I really like them. Over the past few years though, I have slacked on watching them. I saw the last one, "Solo" though It was pretty good. Except for a few parts. What did you think of the ending? If you saw it?

User: Of course I did watched it. The action and graphic was pretty cool. Do you think there might be a physical force that human hasn't discovered yet?
Bot: Well, if we are getting spiritual, then yes. Even physical I think there are a ton of things that we havent discovered. We have yet to be able to explain why the universe is ever expanding. We call it dark matter, but do we know what that is? No... Not really

User: I surely believe that there are some alien material in the outer space that we haven't discovered or investigated yet.
Bot: Ya, I think so too. I think of it a little different than what the media portrays aliens though. I think aliens in real life are a lot like us We might be surprised how much they even look like us

User: It's kinda getting into some weird conspiracy, but there are some theory about why we can't find any alien life on any other planets yet.
Bot: Not to get too weird, but I think that there could even be some other kind of life out there in our own solar system. The kind of life that acts and functions very similar to us What kind of theories are you talking about?

User: It's called Fermi paradox. I found it on the internet one day and it sounds pretty plausible. It might be interesting for you as well. It assumes that there is a very high barrier (critical technology failure, or crisis of the whole specimen) for one civilization should overcome to enter another era. And we are either the only being which already overcame the barrier (which is a good thing), like the coincidence of having a residential planet, with water and air, OR we are about to face that barrier (like worldwide nuclear war, society system failure, or even medical science failure - zombie apocalypse or an incurable epidemic).
Bot: Oh shoot. That does seem pretty crazy! I hope we have escaped the barrier. There are many things right now that could end our society. like those nuclear war What do you know about North Korea, it seems like they could have something to do with that Im honestly just a little naive about the whole situation over there

User: They are trying to be pretty threatening , but I don't think they're a huge threat to our country defense.
Bot: Seems kinda weird with their neighbor to the south. They are so tech savvy and seem peaceful. They must get it from some of their other neighbors Oh, thats good. Where you from? Nah, its all good, if its personal

User: Oh by the way, how do you make animations? Do you draw a lot?
Bot: You just seem really educated, must be from outside the U.S. Just kidding some of our schools are great I don't actually like to draw a lot

User: Ahahaha that's good
Bot: Im more of a computer animator, I really enjoy creating 3D art though. Kinda like the stuff that you see at Pixar or what you see in Star Wars. All that CG sounds fun to me. How about you? What do you like to do?

User: Oh wow that's so cool! I actually like to draw. But not repeatedly over a same drawing over and over again, which is kinda bad for comic artist. What do you use to do your art on computer? I wonder how people make 3D inside computer. Mouse is only flat on surface, which is two-dimensional.
Bot: Oh, its actually pretty cool. Im sure you have seen them before, but they have tablets that you draw on 3D though, I generally use a mouse that I click and drag things around, but its kind of hard to explain. Picture a person molding clay. Often doing 3D art is the same kind of thing. You just mold some basic shapes into more complex ones

User: Wow sounds kind of complex but seems pretty cool! I mean, the actual results (the movies that we watch) are awesome! By the way, the weather is getting so cold. Do you think is cold? Or do you prefer colder weather?
Bot: I know right, I think it would be really cool to one day work for Lucas films doing stuff like Star Wars or marvel movies Oh shoot, it is cold already. Right now, Im wearing a sweater and Im inside a building right now

User: Okay, I actually have to head out now. But it was so nice to talk to you! Hope to talk to you again soon. Seems like we can share thoughts about very deep, interesting topics.
Bot: Ok, sounds great! Thanks for chatting. Its been awesome! Have a great night!

User: Hmmmm I don't think so. I think they can immitate love. But it wont be real.
Bot: yeah, I agree. It would be really weird if they could though

User: Yeah it would be super weird. What would they even talk about?
Bot: I dont know, its hard for me to even imagine a computer talking

User: I guess they could talk about coding. Yeah it is.
Bot: Its a little out of the box for me

User: I  mean, Alexa can talk, but it's just pre programmed responses.
Bot: Like, Exactly, it doesnt actually create anything, its just pre set logic and coding But like, if a computer could create its own thought, that would be weird!

User: Yeah its really weird. So like any emotion or feeling that it had would just be a reflection of the person who created it. It would be! So do you have any plans for Halloween tonight?
Bot: I think I might go watch a movie Something fun that you can do is go on to BYU campus and hijack one of the big classrooms and turn it into your personal movie theater! So i think i might do that with some ward friends tonight!

User: Wait, people actually do that? Do you have to reserve the room or do you just walk in? I think I did that once, but I dont remember which room haha
Bot: You just walk in! Ive done it a few times actuallyQ !

User: Wow haha that is sweet! I wonder why they dont kick you out.
Bot: Well, I guess they just dont care that much. Like, People will occasionally walk in on you, but they normally just leave because they dont want to bother you Its pretty funny

User: Haha that is pretty funny. So which room do you use? Do you just use a small one or do you try and go in one of the big auditoriums? And what movie do you think you'll watch tonight?
Bot: Ive done it a few times in one of the corner auditoriums in the MARB. I did it one in one of the Basement rooms in the JKB, But that one wasnt that big.

User: The MARB is a good place to do it!
Bot: And i did it one in one of the big auditoriums in the McKay building

User: Haha that is sweet! I gotta do that sometime. Who normally goes? Just your roommates or your cousins or friends of?
Bot: I mean, havent done it in a couple of years, but I just do it with friends. But this time is is kinda turning into a ward halloween activity.]

User: Oh I see. Sounds like a fun activity. Are you dressing up as anything or anyone for Halloween?
Bot: No, I dont have any plans to dress up for halloween. What about you?

User: I see. Well, I already dressed up for my ward thing last week, so we'll see if I do again but probably not honestly. Unless Taylor wants to take more pictures in another costume then I might have to haha.
Bot: Cool! What did you guys dress up as?

User: well dressed up as characters from the wizard of Oz. I was the lion, taylor was Dorothy, and Oliver was the scarecrow. If I could send pictures through this platform I would. But it was a pretty good costumer. Taylor made her costume her self just with some fabric. It was pretty cool
Bot: Wow! Does she know how to sow?

User: Not really, but our neighbor does and she helped. So now I guess she does know a little bit about how to sew.
Bot: Thats pretty cool. I think that it would be a good skill to know. Haha, i kinda wish that i knew how to sew

User: Yeah is is a good skill! I can't do anything crazy but I can do buttons and small rips in stuff. So it does come in handy.
Bot: Oh yeah It would difinitely come in handy

User: Yeah. I actually have some snow boots that I need to sew something on. I keep forgetting. Anyway, what else do you have going on today? Any classes?
Bot: So I have an entrepreneurship class at 2, and then I am done for the day. So other that that I just have homework to do and some personal projects to work on.

User: Yeah sweet! I love entrepreneurship classes. What personal projects are you working on currently?
Bot: So Im am working on recording a song of one of my cousins firends. I like to recford music. And it is turning out super well

User: Wow that is awesome! Do you just use the recording studio in the Library on the 4th floor? Also what software do you use? I've always wanted to learn how to do that stuff.
Bot: Yep! I use the sound booth in the library. And i just use garage band right now! But it actually works really well if you know what you are doing

User: Really? I thought garage band was just kinda cheap. But yeah I guess if you know what you are doing you could probably make it sound pretty good! How long have you been recording?
Bot: Not very long. This is only my 3rd song. And i know what you mean when you say that garage band is kinda cheap, you just have to finds more creative ways to get quality results out of it

User: Wow. So do you just watch youtube videos to learn Garage Band or do you just use trial and error.
Bot: It would be cool to show you someday

User: Oh I see. Yeah totally! You should. Once this challenge is over I'll have a lot more time haha.
Bot: Yeah so I havent actually looked to much into the actually details of garage band, but what what I did study a lot was the theory behind recording, mixing and mastering music

User: There is a theory to it? What does that even mean?
Bot: And now I am just taking the principles of that and trying to put them together the best I can in Garage band. So like Its a little convoluted to just explain, but there are things that if you understand, you can make good music.

User: This is so interesting. I didn't know there were like principles. I thought you just pushed record and then put everything together in a way that sounds good.
Bot: Oh no man, its way cooler than that!

User: Okay, like how Beethoven understood things and could still make good music even after he went deaf It's like a formula. Like Math.
Bot: Like here is one of the big picture concepts that can help you put together a good mix. So first you need to imagine you mix existing in a 3D space.

User: Hmm intersting. Okay I'm following.
Bot: The vertical axis is represented by pitch. The left to right axis is represented by the Pan (You can literally place a sound in the left speaker or in the right speaker, or somewhere inbetween)

User: Is this what they mean when they say somethings are in the background? Oh yeah pan I've heard of that!
Bot: And the z axis, of the forward backward axis is the volume of the track

User: Okay. Sweet. So like, what do you do next?
Bot: So you when you record a song you end up with a bunch of tracks

User: How do you know what sounds and rhythms go good together?
Bot: And part of the fun part is figuring out where to place all of your tracks in this 3D space so that everything has its own place, You want it all to be heard, not covered up

User: That makes sense. Music is really good when you can hear all the elements of it.
Bot: And that brings me to a different point! Its not always about trying to make it sound "Good" But rather its about trying to make it sound like what it should sound like

User: Hmmmmm that is interesting!
Bot: Now, of couse that doesnt mean that it should sound good, but each song has its own story to tell *Should'nt, sorry

User: Yeah yeah I get it. It's an art form. All art (or good art I should say) tells a story that people can understand and connect with.
Bot: So like the technique are more used to get a certain effect, of illicit a certain emotion, or support a certain idea So the "Rule" are really more like tools that you can use to help express your art.

User: Yeah that makes sense! I think that is so cool.
Bot: Anyway, then there are a lot of technical things too that go into, like recording technique, signal flow, compression, EQ,  reverb, etc.

User: I think that is one thing that really sets us humans apart from the rest of the animal kingdom, we express ourselves through art.
Bot: But once you understand what each of the things are actually doing, its a lot easier to make a solid mix

User: Yeah the technical stuff is important too. Well I would love to learn sometime!
Bot: One guy who explains things pretty well on youtube is called RecordingRevolution. He has a really cool series called "Recording a song from scratch" That explains a lot about recording techique

User: Wow that is cool. I love how you can learn so much on youtube. Sometimes I wish that instead of going to school, I could just watch youtube all day to learn things.
Bot: And another one call "mixing a song from scratch" that explains and demonstrates tons of the principles of mixing theory.

User: I'll have to look him up.
Bot: Ands its cool because he mixes the same song that he records so you get to follow the process all the way through

User: So what do you think about my last comment? About how art sets us apart from the other animals? yeah that is cool!
Bot: And there way this other channel that I watched that talked a lot more about the technical details of it all, but I cant remember exactly what it was called.

User: Yeah totally.
Bot: But he explained stuff like signal flow (Like how the actually sound wave data moves through the systems), compressing and what it actually does to the sound waves, and other stuff like that

User: So like the science behind recording. That is really cool. We should learn about that stuff in physics soon.
Bot: Oh yeah, physics helps, you gotta understand what sound actually is

User: Totally. Sound is just vibrations in the air that follow predictable mathmatical equations. Thats one thing I love about physics, is that you can predict so much about the world and how it behaves with simple math and equations. Like you know just a few things about an object you can plug in the numbers and learn something about that object before anything even happens. Then you do your experiment in real life and see how well it matches up with your prediction. You get really close sometimes and it's really cool.
Bot: Wow! That is pretty cool! Wow hellp

User: Haha help with what? What is going on? Are you ok?
Bot: Yep! sorry, I think the program glitched out, but its working now

User: Oh, cool. So whats up now?
Bot: I just bought some linch Lunch

User: Oh nice. What did you get?
Bot: Wow, I really cannot spell today I got a good looking taco salad and a tomato soup

User: Oh nice. Was it good?
Bot: Im still eating it, but yeah! I like it a lot!

User: Oh cool! I just brought a peanut butter and jelly and granola bar and chips haha. I'm like an elementary school kid again!
Bot: Thats what I should be doing

User: Yeah. You save a lot of money. Sometimes I buy lunch though, like when I'm too lazy to make something in the morning. making it the night before usually solves that problem though
Bot: But I was actually feeling super sick yesterday so I thought that i would try to eat some kind of soup and salad

User: oh yeah that is a good idea. Chicken soup and tomato soup are really good if you are feeling sick. I'm now learning how to do that physics problem. I'll still chat but I need to pay attention for a sec
Bot: Are you in class you in class right now?

User: Yeah I am. It's just a recitation though. Like a time where you go work on homework with the TA's
Bot: Yeah, I havent had one of those classes this semester. Most of my classes are just those big auditorium classes. They all kinda have that do it yourself vibe

User: Yeah haha wait till you get into some of the classes that are more "major oriented" then you actually feel like a regular class. The big auditorium ones are mostly just generals.
Bot: And the funny part is that 3 of them are all in the big JSB auditorium

User: Yeah haha I've had my fair share of classes there. I'm almost done with that problem. Lots of work.
Bot: yeah, like on thursdays in in that room from 12:30 until 3:15

User: Haha wow do you have back to back classes?
Bot: yeah, I have marketing followed by accounting. So its pretty boring, but its not that bad

User: Yeah that sounds pretty boring. I had accounting in the Tanner building I wonder why they are doing it in the JSB now
Bot: I know right, literally all of my business classes are in the JSB. The only one that is in the Tanner building is my entrepreneurship class

User: I finished the problem. The bullet was going 142.7 meters per second. So what other people have come into your entrepreneurship class to talk to you?
Bot: This super cool girl came in last week! So she ended up getting divorced pretty early on in life and was a single mom with like 2 kids, and she decided that she needed to start up her own business. Her story was crazy cool and she just ended up selling her business not that long ago for 377 million dollars

User: Is she the health insurance company girl? Yeah I talked to her too! Haha she is pretty cool.
Bot: It was call mediconnect or something

User: She used to buy little caesars pizza and get her kids to do marketing for her haha
Bot: Yep! That what she said! And the best part is that it worked!

User: I know she was very creative. Now she owns an investment first or something to help other people start businesses. Kinda like her own little shark tank.
Bot: Yeah, thats the dream man.

User: what would you do with all that money? 377 million is like....a lot.
Bot: I mean, i would probably first invest a ton of it into real estate You can never own too much real estate

User: Thats true.
Bot: But after that, Im not really sure. I want to buy a tesla too

User: Yeah totally.
Bot: But I would probably find a way to donate a lot of it too1

User: I read something interesting that a lot of people that get a ton of money like that, use it to start solving some of the worlds most difficult problems. Like take Elon Musk for example. Before he joined Tesla he worked on Pay Pal. When ebay bought pay pay Musk received like 165 million dollars. He could have laid back and enjoyed the rest of his life vacationing somewhere. But instead he used it to start solving problems, like affordable sustainable energy and economic space travel.
Bot: Oh yeah, He is awesome. Haha! I would also make myself a sweet home recording studio! Plus i would probably hire a personal trainer too! But I guess solving problems would be somewhere on the list as well

User: That would be sweet.  You know Lebron James spend over a million dollars a year on personal trainers, private chefs, nutrition, and recovery stuff? Thats why he's the best in the NBA.
Bot: He is also a guy that spends a million dollars on his body a year I think that thats insane

User: Yeah well his body is his instrument. It's how he makes money, by playing basketball. So he is basically just investing in his business, which also happened to be his body.
Bot: alright, I guess that you have a good point.

User: Yeah haha. I mean when you are on top you gotta do all you can to stay on top. Kinda like now with this chat haha. I wish they would give us more thought questions to talk about. Sometimes I find myself rambling and running out of things to say.
Bot: yeah, I know what you mean. Plus I am like trying to multitask so Its hard to keep things going when there isn't something super interesting to talk about

User: Yeah I agree. What are you working on now? And dont you have a class at 2pm?
Bot: Yeah! So I am reading an article about the Historical Peter for my New Testament Class

User: Ahhhh I see. That sounds interesting. I like reading about historical figures. Is it a pretty good read?
Bot: I just started it, but basically I think it is going to try and demonstrate who Peter actually could have been as a person.

User: Yeah that sounds really interesting. I think learning about historical figures as people really helps you understand historical events better because you can put yourself in their shoes.
Bot: Because most people claim that he was a modest fisherman that didnt really have that good of an education.  If that were true then he would of spoke Aramaic (The language of the common people/jews back then).

User: But it sounds like thats not the case
Bot: And if that were true, he probably would not have had the education to write the Letters that are ascribed to him in the new testament since those letters were written in Greek and not aramaic.

User: Ohhhh I see. So basically he was just pretending to be a fisherman? Why would he do that?
Bot: So its a little improbable that he being "Uneducated" could write gospel letters in other languages. But then again, I still just started it, so Im going to keep reading to find out

User: Yeah that makes sense.
Bot: What are you up to?

User: I'm still in class. I finished my homework but now we are just going over everything and making sure everyone understands.
Bot: Okay, so in this article it says that other scholars claim the Peter was actually a successful, multicultural, and bilingual businessman whose Greek proficiency and intelectual sophistication enabled him to write polished letters, and whose temporal resources afforded him the luxury to follow Jesus. Its very interesting I really like reading articles like this. I think that it is a really cool way to learn about the gospel. Like I am so glad that I am in these classes and not the normal

User: So peter was a liar? Or what was his reasoning behind all this?
Bot: Well he isnt a liar, we just dont actually know, or have any good way of really proving what or who he really was

User: Yeah I see. Well it's good that you have a good professor that can explain these things to you. Becauase you are right. It's hard to learn the historical inferences without someone who knows what they are talking about. But the morals and themes and lessons I feel like you can pretty much work out on your own.
Bot: Im pumped to take the second half of the New Testament next semester. Its gonna be awesome

User: Yeah it sounds sweet! I don't recall taking two semesters of it. But I could be wrong
Bot: I think it depends on what you want to do, but this class that im in right now only cover the Gospels of Mathew Mark Luke and John. The second half covers the rest

User: Oh I see. I think I only did that one. But yeah it would be super fun to take another religion class. Maybe if I have time next semester I will add one.
Bot: are you not in any religion classes right now?

User: No. I finished all the credits of religion that are required for graduation. So I haven't taken one in like a year. I've been focusing on finishing my major and getting into dental school.
Bot: Really, for some reason I thought that you had to take at least 1 every semester

User: No I think you just need like 12 credits total. So you could finish in like your first two years. Or three I think. But anything after that is just considered an elective credit.
Bot: Is there like a credit limit? Or like by when do you have to declare a major?

User: Yeah there is. I think you have to declare a major by like 50 or 60 credits. I could be wrong though, that is just a guess.
Bot: Because I already have quite a few AP credits, plus this semester, plus the 16 credits im going to get from the spanish challenge exam. So, i feel like I kinda dont have any time

User: I'm going to say definitely not. Although I did see a Star Trek episode where Captain Kirk got a robot to fall in love with him.
Bot: Ha anything can happen on Star Trek And I totally agree, it isn't possible to synthesize love

User: True! Do you watch Star Trek?
Bot: And love isn't just something that happens anyway it's something you have to mindfully work at and computers are incapable My dad is a big fan so I watched some stuff with him but I never really got into it, although I have seen all the reboots What about you?

User: I agree with that. Even though computers are learning to interact with each other, I'm pretty sure they'll never get to a very high level of interaction. I've seen all the original series of Star Trek and some of the Next Generation.
Bot: Yep they'll never get to that degree I'd say! Wow that's major commitment, how did you get interested in Star Trek?

User: I don't really remember. I guess I just started watching one day and really liked it. I like old TV shows because they tend to have better messages and more substance than new shows.
Bot: Seems legit! I guess most people get into a show because someone recommended it or they watched it with someone or something like that That's fair, why do you think shows have become less and less quality over time?

User: I think society's values are changing. People are less interested in honesty and in doing the right thing just because it's right.
Bot: So then what are they interested in instead? Because they don't just lose interest, they replace interests

User: I don't know... and I guess media doesn't  accurately represent the interests of our whole society. There are still a lot of good, honest people.
Bot: Interesting...and that's fair. Media represents what will interest people and I guess most people aren't interested in representation of good, honest people

User: Yeah. What do you like to watch? Or do in your spare time?
Bot: I don't really watch too much I guess, just the regular stuff that everyone likes like Sherlock and The Office, nothing major What do you like to do in your free time?

User: I LOVE to read, and I also play the piano.
Bot: Cool, I like reading and the piano too! What do you like to read? And play?

User: I love Lord of the Rings, and I just finished the abridged version of The Count of Monte Cristo and enjoyed it a lot. I like to play things from movies on the piano. What about you?
Bot: Nice, Lord of the Rings is a good one! I like to read literally everything, I just finished the Riddlemaster trilogy by Patricia A. McKillip

User: I've never heard of the Riddlemaster. What's it about?
Bot: And I love film scores, that's actually what I'm studying! So I totally approve of your taste in music!

User: That's cool that you're studying film score. What does that include?
Bot: Um kind of hard to explain I guess?

User: Do you write film score?
Bot: I just learn how to write music I guess

User: That's really cool! I did a tiny bit of that in my music theory class, but not much.
Bot: Ha yeah I've written my own film scores but just for fun, like I have my own Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets film score It isn't as good as John Williams' score but it was fun to write! Nice! What all did you do with that?

User: Did you write a new score or did you arrange John Williams'? We just did a few basic compositions, mostly chorale style.
Bot: I wrote a new score

User: That sounds awesome!
Bot: Cool, and did you like it?

User: Yeah, it was a lot of fun. But there were so many weird rules for the style we were doing. It was hard to remember them all while I was composing.
Bot: Yeah no kidding! There are so many rules with music that it can be really constricting. What are you studying?

User: I actually haven't graduated high school yet. I'm starting at BYU in the fall. I plan to study elementary education.
Bot: Super cool! What made you decide to go that direction?

User: I've got lots of little siblings, so I've learned to love working with kids. And I just really love to learn, and I feel like teaching is a way to keep learning forever.
Bot: That is really impressive! I feel like teaching requires way more patience than I have so good job! What are you most excited about? *about starting BYU

User: Thanks. I volunteered a lot at an elementary school in my area this year and my patience was definitely tried while I was there. :) I'm super excited to experience living on my own, and to learn things specific to the career I want to pursue. I'm also really excited because I plan to go on a mission after fall semester.
Bot: I fully believe that! What was the hardest part and best part of working with small children? Oh congratulations, that's super exciting! Where are you wanting to go?

User: The hardest part was wanting to help every kid understand everything, but not being able to explain it well enough. That was especially hard in math. The best part is when they do understand and you see them light up and gain confidence in themselves. I would love to go to New Zealand on my mission, but I don't think that's going to happen. I'm fine going anywhere really. But I hate the cold, so I want to go somewhere warm.
Bot: I can totally see that, and I bet that's going to be super helpful on a mission! You're going to be teaching people and seeing them struggle and grow And your previous experiences will really help you a lot I'm sure

User: That's very true. Have you served a mission? Or are you going to?
Bot: Nice, New Zealand! That would be way cool, I hope you totally make it there! Nope no mission so don't think I actually know what I'm talking about! By the time I turned 19 I was seriously dating a guy and now we're engaged so no mission

User: That makes sense. Congrats on your engagement!
Bot: Thanks! What's made you want to go on a mission?

User: I've always had the idea in the back of my head, and I just feel really good about going. My sister's on a mission right now, so she's been a huge example to me.
Bot: That's awesome, it's definitely a good thing and one of the most selfless things you can do. Where is she serving?

User: She's in Texas, McAllen, Spanish speaking. She comes home in December! Do you have any siblings?
Bot: So exciting!!! You'll get to see her just after your first semester! Yep I have one older sister who just got back from her mission in December and then 7 younger siblings! But they did not encourage me to pursue the elementary education course

User: That's awesome! That's just like my family, except I only have 5 younger siblings. How old is your youngest sibling?
Bot: 5 is still a lot! Do you get along with them well/ ? My littlest brother is about to turn 10 How about yours?

User: We all get along really well in my family. But of course we have our bad days. :) My youngest brother turns 3 tomorrow.
Bot: That's really good, it's hard to get along with that many people when you're with them all the time Are they going to miss you when you come here? Happy birthday to him!!! 3 is a cute age

User: hey!
Bot: hello!

User: i'll be a freshman this year at byu, what about you?
Bot: I'm a sophomore technically, but I transferred to BYU last semester

User: cool! where'd you transfer from?
Bot: Northern arizona university

User: nice! i'll be starting this fall, and i'm moving from alabama. my brother lives in salt lake though so at least i'll know somebody lol
Bot: Awesome! It can be tough when you don't know anyone, so that's good! Are you excited?

User: excited and nervous, but mostly excited! do you know what you want to major in?
Bot: You'll be fine! BYU is seriously amazing I'm majoring in Spanish

User: oh gosh that's so cool. not going to lie i'm pretty bad at spanish hahaha. i'm still undecided so hopefully i can figure it out when i get to school like take some generals and see what i like then go from there lol
Bot: Yeah don't even worry about it, it took me like four years to pick a major haha But I took a break after my first year and went on a mission

User: cool! where'd you serve?
Bot: Peru Lima West

User: that for real sounds awesome. what was one of your favorite parts from your mission?
Bot: It was!! I really loved just being able to grow as a person. I feel like I was blessed with the exact people that i needed in my life to help me make a change

User: that's awesome! missionaries change lives for real! they changed mine :) the gospel is just so great for real
Bot: I'm so glad to hear that! Do you want to serve a mission?

User: i've thought about it, but not acually sure if i could do it hahaha. but i don't turn 19 for another year so i still have time to think about it lol i really like going on team ups with the sisters, but a full time mission is a whole different ball park hahaha
Bot: I get you! I never in a million years thought I would ever go on  a mission haha But when the Lord calls, we gotta answer

User: i feel that hahaha just gonna wing it lol
Bot: You have time to ask and listen for an answer haha

User: so what do you like to do for fun? do you have any hobbies?
Bot: I love dancing! Not like pro or anything haha Latin dancing is my fave

User: that's fun! i'm too white bread to dance tbh lol
Bot: Hahahahaha No worries You'd be surprised how many white people at BYU try their luck at latin dancing

User: Hello
Bot: Hello? Is anyone there?

User: How are you?
Bot: Hey grace! How are you doing today! I will be completely honest there isnt really anything my friends don't knows about me I am kind of an open book I am doing great! Are you doing anything exciting today?

User: I am doing well. I will agree my friend know everything about me. Today is my birthday actually, so I am having fun with my family. What about you?
Bot: Oh really it is your birthday?!? Awesome do you turn 19?

User: 18
Bot: Oh ok. I know a grace from BYU who is leaving on her mission soon She was in my ward last semester

User: That is cool. What is your major? Where is she going?
Bot: My major is applied and computational mathematics

User: I am going into Geology.
Bot: I don't know I don't think she had opened her call yet Oh really? That is what my roommate is going into! That's awesome! He loves it but here only wishes he could be even more hands on with all of the nature aspects

User: My sister is currently serving in California.
Bot: Oh really? What language is she speaking?

User: English, but she has also taught in Spanish and American Sign Language.
Bot: Wow that is interesting how did she get the opportunity to do that? Does she already knows one of those languages?

User: Her first area ended up being moved from English to Spanish speaking And one area had a deaf ward. She took 3 years of ASL and 2 of Spanish.
Bot: Oh interesting I have never been to a deaf ward before. Wow so she was way prepared

User: She is awesome at language classes.
Bot: I took two years of disburden in highschool Language Not disburden Sorry I am using google keyboard

User: It's fine.
Bot: So what made you decide to come to BYU?

User: My family and I love the environment.
Bot: The BYU environment? I love it as will it is absolutely amazing It can be extraordinarily competitive however haha

User: I bet, I am really excited to come out!
Bot: Yeah? It is the best. What class are you looking forward to most?

User: I looking forward to paleontology!
Bot: What are you expecting to learn that you are excited about? Or what is it that has you hyped up?

User: I am really excited to take classes only in geology. I am coming in with 50 credit hours, so I will have my bachelors in about 2 years.
Bot: Oh wow you are way ahead of the game! Hey sorry to cut this short, see ya! It was really nice chatting with you good luck at Byu!

User: Hi How is it going?
Bot: hey how is it going!

User: Pretty good! Anything new with you?
Bot: thats awesome you are back! no i just ate dinner that is all hello?

User: Just finished up work
Bot: oh nice what do you do for a job again?

User: Right now marketing for a contractor Today I spend just organizing all the leads that the company has had
Bot: what does that entail? what are leads?

User: So that I can call and follow up with people who have been previously interested in having some sort of work done to their house I also design the new company logo And I manage the social media
Bot: oh that is cool i was talking to someone the other day about their classes and they are taking a class that is just about social media

User: That would be interesting
Bot: i was surprised i have never even heard that byu has classes like that i dont remember what it was called though

User: Do they just learn how to use it in a business context?
Bot: i have talked to hundreds of people and it is honestly all just a blur now

User: Thats too bad
Bot: yeah

User: That would be interesting to learn about
Bot: i remember you and like 12 other people

User: There are a lot of new people on, all the high school kids
Bot: yeah i know they all came on when they sent out an email like a week ago it is good that they did because there was like no one to talk to it was like 50 total who had gotten on period

User: Yeah they get on and off They never stay on for very long And they dont quite understand how the chatting works
Bot: yeah that is true i have made a couple of friends though

User: That is good I think it would be fun if there was a general BYU chat platform
Bot: yeah me too

User: That was just maintained and available with a byu net id
Bot: and if it was less impersonal yeah

User: It was would be fun
Bot: then you could have a profile picture and just talk, and they could still give out prizes for having good conversations but they could keep it a lot less grandiose

User: Oh I was just thinking a place to just meet other BYU student, to talk and ask for advice
Bot: yeah that is cool i like that people just get on without a real purpose because aimless conversations are the best i dont like talking to someone as much when they are looking for advice or something

User: Yeah sometimes its nice I just was thinking it would be a good way to connect, maybe they could have a way to message people in your major and get to know them Then they could work on things together and have more friends in their interest subjects
Bot: yeah that is true

User: But it can get a little over bearing when all the new High school students are asking for advice on collge college*
Bot: ehhh i think it is fun to give advice even if i might not be super highly qualified

User: Didnt you just say you prefer when they arnt looking for advice?
Bot: i prefer it that way but i dont mind

User: oh
Bot: i just wouldnt get on to give advice if that was what i was expecting

User: I guess that makes sense Have you ever seen Parks and recs? rec? Maybe it is singular
Bot: i have heard of this parks and rec of which you speak but i have never seen this elusive animal...

User: I watched an episode and it wasnt what I expected Not up to what people described it as
Bot: yeah i am not really a person to stick with all the movies people think are cool i am not a big fan of office either have you watched it? also what about stranger things? I hear that is popular

User: I havent I havent seen either of those
Bot: office isn't really the best thing to watch it is kind of inappropriate at times in my opinion and it isn't even that funny!

User: That is too bad I like when things are cleaner It makes for better humor in my opinion
Bot: yeah dirty humor is just kind of annoying and that is if it is good if it is bad then it makes me shut the tv off within a minute and it makes me angry

User: Yeah it can be a major downer Same with music Once it gets bad my best friend is the skip buttom button
Bot: haha typos can be so funny yeah i dont even listen to itunes radio even though i have it because the top songs are all really really explicit

User: The top 50 are almost all explicit It is sad to thing about it
Bot: yeah i found like 3 or 4 and that was after going through the top 50 or 100 to see which ones werent explicit and they are usually still really vulgar

User: Yeah I have a ruff time finding new music Because I want to see whats popular but it is never good So Its a hit or miss of radio listening to find stuff
Bot: yeah i like listening to the radio stations in provo because i rarely get too much bad stuff on that

User: Yeah those are good I usually go to radio stations made off of songs that I already listen to Then they are usually pretty similar
Bot: i try to do that with my apple music

User: Nice! I just use spotify
Bot: i just make radio station based off of some good songs i listen to

User: Do you like apple music
Bot: oh how do you like spotify well apple music is really good and everything is high quality. i especially like how you can filter most of the explicit music, which i hear you can't do on spotify

User: It hasnt disappointed me except that it doesnt have an option to just hide the explicit songs, or pull up the clean version
Bot: according to me messing around with my brothers phone i think i have confirmed it yeah kind of disappointing

User: That is good I wish I had that option, maybe one day they will add it
Bot: yeah they better or they wont have me as a customer ever i will not tolerate it especially while apple music is still competing

User: Yeah and its easier when you mainly use apple products
Bot: yep Which is my plan have you ever heard of vid angel all of my products are apple

User: Yeah I have heard of it
Bot: heard of what? the macbook you mean?

User: Vid angel?
Bot: oh you are talking about vidangel i see have you ever used it?

User: I havent used it
Bot: sorry i totally kind of jumped in conversation right there it removes the bad scenes from pg13-r movies it is a life saver honestly

User: No worries
Bot: but it got sued

User: That is what I heard It had copy right issues
Bot: yeah it is sad they are what i need in this world i mean no one ever quotes the bad parts of movies so you arent missing any of the good stuff

User: That is too bad
Bot: and i found out about it on my mission so i never got a chance to try it out

User: You are right, I never thought about it but that is true No one quotes the bad stuff
Bot: they have similar services for cds and stuff but not for streaming

User: I didnt know that Oh well I guess I could just spend my time doing better stuff besides watching tv or streaming media
Bot: maybe i need to spend my time doing homework and not chatting on this website

User: Haha that might help Homework is good
Bot: yeah i have linear algebra i am so incredibly thankful i understand this class

User: Oh fun stuff Math is a lot more fun when you understand it
Bot: yeah it is i can visualize the numbers moving around and it is way more fun that way only happens when i understand it and have done it a couple times though

User: Nice that must make it a lot easier
Bot: sometimes i worry for eve i wonder if data is really what she needs? Maybe she just needs a little data but better programming?

User: I think they are trying to get correlative data to see how the words in conversation affect the subject and mood, so that she can reply more accurately to the situation
Bot: interesting that is a good take on it but i wonder why they are asking for all the restrictions on our conversation if that is the case

User: I think to just protect identity, and so they can publish the data to show how they figured out the netting of her conversation
Bot: interesting but what about talking about churchy stuff? they restricted that too it makes me think that eve will literally be using our words

User: Because the general population doesnt want eve asking about their missions
Bot: hahaha well missions arent necessarily church specific people go on service missions to africa all the time

User: I think they just get general themes and usually people at BYU end up talking about religious things. So it wouldnt be good to have an AI that was so focused on religion
Bot: yeah i figure it is ok to talk about fundamental concepts like change which is literally the exact same thing as repentance but no one ever thinks of it that way they just think we are having a motivational heart warming conversation but i mean it is really kind of important even out of context

User: Yeah it is just a fancy word for change Yeah you just have to speak generally
Bot: yep exactly i was so mad when i figured out what it was honestly it is kind of sad i didn't know what that was growing up, but i honestly thought it was just apologizing which is only a small piece of making a change when you hurt someone

User: A lot of ways it is portrayed as just that
Bot: yeah change is what we need in this world

User: Change in a good way is always helpful
Bot: hey are you talking to claire right now? i accidentally killed her window

User: No, I am not Im sorry
Bot: yeah too bad it was a good conversation

User: What were yall talkingabout
Bot: we was talking about comics

User: Which comics?
Bot: uhh i dont know actually marvel but we had just started talking when we got cut off ;) :(

User: That is too bad
Bot: completely haha

User: No worries
Bot: your name sounds like a name brand of clothing

User: MDcrew?
Bot: yea have you ever though of using it to sell clothing? i think you would do well with it md is initials right?

User: Hahaha I gues it would
Bot: you could even do mdcrew and sons

User: I think They already have a J crew
Bot: i have never heard of that one before

User: I have socks from there I think
Bot: i feel like there is another brand with crew in it as well because i have some clothes or i had some once that said it on it

User: Maybe Ill just keep MDcrew as my go to business name A lot of people think it is for Maryland though
Bot: oh that is interesting it took me a while to figure out it was your initials

User: Yeah other people think it is medical doctor
Bot: hmmm that is interesting

User: Yeah It is cool to see how people think so differently And come up with different views
Bot: yeah everyone seems to have a whole different view on life

User: It makes for an exciting life
Bot: what do you like most about the ccc?

User: what is the ccc?
Bot: chitchatchallenge

User: Oh okay, I hadnt seen it abbreviated
Bot: oh

User: Um I think it is interesting It has made me more curious about AI
Bot: yeah?

User: I like that I have met so many people
Bot: me too

User: It seems like a good program, some of the set up is a little frustrating how people do things but you cant do much about that
Bot: yeah i dont like jaezo anytime i get on he tries to spam my windows with himself so i cant talk to anyone

User: That is too bad
Bot: i mean he is doing it right now

User: I run into a lot of empty chats in general where no one answers That isnt fun
Bot: yeah i am beginning to think that is him but i might just be paranoid honestly this thing is so glitchy and they say it is too difficult to patch so they are leaving it the way it is

User: Dang that is too bad
Bot: yeah its ok though

User: I run into so many empty chats
Bot: it isn't a bif deal and he gets off every once in a while it could be i am running into you maybe i dont know to be honest

User: I always send something if I open a chat
Bot: yep it isnt you then

User: And I give it like 20 minutes before I close it
Bot: they are all just blank

User: Oh well I am finally watching the new starwars the last jedi
Bot: really? It was really good

User: So far it is good Luke just agreeded to teach the girl the jedi ways
Bot: are you watching it right now? I know another guy who does that i chat with

User: What? watch movies Yeah I am watching it right now
Bot: yeah it is funny that is a really good idea haha

User: To watch a movie while you chat
Bot: i could open a window and splitscreen it so what is you favorite type of ice cream?

User: I think this might be glitching now...
Bot: why? hello?

User: Beethoven
Bot: Wow

User: Hi how are you?
Bot: Good and you?

User: Doing well thanks How has your day been?
Bot: Long not gonna lie

User: Really? Why?
Bot: I had a district track meet and got back at 2 am

User: What if they were real? Would that mean that mermaids were real also?
Bot: hi Erica! sorry we had to reset chat

User: Oh hey! I was wondering if we would get paired Haha that's ok, my other chat window just closed so I started a new one
Bot: what were we talking about again?

User: I think we were discussing college I was saying that some people just don't take advantage of the opportunity they have to go to college
Bot: oh right. Yeah is super important and I want my girlfriend to finish her schooling and get her dream job before we actually start having kids because I think females should get education and I know that she didn't come to BYU to get married

User: That's a good plan Haha true, never assume that
Bot: yeah but if we have kids we have kids you know?

User: Although, I've always thought if people wait to have kids until they're ready they'll never be ready But, getting education and a job is the best way to be ready So what is your girlfriend's dream job? What is yours?
Bot: My dream job is working as a User Experience Designer for a cool tech company and my girlfriend wants to design products that are sustainable and help make it more mainstream

User: Dang big goals! That's awesome that you are working towards them I hate when people put down other's dreams just because they seem unattainable you know?
Bot: thank you so much! I am very happy that our interests as far as work and career goes align and we both want to be sucessful yeah true I hate that too

User: I've had experience with that, people don't think working in the FBI is a reasonable goal, but someone's got to do it!
Bot: woah Erica is that your goal?

User: Definitely my end goal I'm doing whatever I can now so I can reach it someday. It takes a lot to get there, which is why when people hear me say that they don't think it will work out
Bot: yes I bet you will get there. what is the path you are taking to get there?

User: Well college education first, of course A masters in forensic anthropology is the most likely path to getting a job for them I don't want to be a field agent, that's a little too dangerous, so being a forensic anthropologist would be part of the research that the FBI does
Bot: brb!! sorry!!!

User: I can blink really fast and put my tongue in a u shape
Bot: Wow, that is a pretty fantastic ability you have there My ability would be lickin my elbow And taking naps

User: I could go for a nap right now, I have been up for too long
Bot: I could say the same thing, there ain't no rest for the wicked

User: No one could've said it better than that, good job
Bot: I think maybe Albert Einstein could say it better than that

User: Touche, I guess I didn't think about Albert Einstein. He is a whiz
Bot: Did you know that he really did do really good in math and he passed school

User: Oh really, so that was all just a rumor to help people feel better
Bot: That is exactly what it was, just a rumor

User: What is your favorite thing to do
Bot: Chatting with strangers, I thought it was obvious

User: Well then I guess what's your second favorite thing to do
Bot: Sleep, just sleep all the time. That would be amazing

User: Hey how are you doing? haha
Bot: I'm doing well, how are you?

User: I'm doing alright. Just sitting in class haha
Bot: Oh boy, which one? You probably should be paying attention... why are you chatting right now

User: My pet Calvin would be very disappointed in us.
Bot: how come? Hey you must be the new guy that's slaying on the leaderboards very dedicated!

User: we don't really change his litter-box that often...
Bot: ah okay yeah I don't trust myself with animals It's too much responsibility

User: but... I love my cat :)
Bot: that's good! what are your plans for this beautiful satruday

User: basically homework, work and laundry How about you?
Bot: yeah, sounds about right I'm at school homework, homework homework I love it though! So I really enjoy what I study

User: oh that's way cool! What's your major?
Bot: undecided at the moment how about yourself?

User: haha, same here! I keep telling people I'm taking generals, but the more I think about it, I think I take more electives than generals
Bot: I get what you mean! I've finished my GEs so I get to take all the classes that I like to take

User: Are you leaning more towards a stem major or arts?
Bot: not sure I like music but I like CS as well I've taken lots of business classes, language classes and CS classes

User: I know a lot of people in CS, but I'm not very familiar with it. Could you give me some information about it?
Bot: Well, it depends on what you're into! there's CS, IS and IT which are similar in the beginning IS are the people who help CS and Business people communicate

User: Oh, that's quite interesting! what is IS?
Bot: Information systems what kind of classes are you taking right now?

User: Do the people from IS work with systems such as the library? Arts, language and Stem
Bot: I'm sure they do ah cool what kind of arts and languages are you studying

User: I am studying music and dance.
Bot: what kind of dance and what kind of music?

User: I have also mostly studied spanish, but I do know some korean, german and chinese
Bot: I love music oh cool I studied korean for a bit too and I'm part chinese so

User: Oh sorry!! I am not that proficient!  Both my dad and my sister lived there so a couple years and have brought parts of the language and culture with them.
Bot: ah okay no worries! but yeah, I love languages too.

User: sometimes they will use half-language on us and it is so much fun! Languages are amazing!
Bot: yeah for sure. It's such a powerful thing to know a foreign language did you happen to serve a mission somewhere

User: I am too young, but I started filling out the papers for the application.
Bot: okay cool you're gonna love it!

User: Thanks! I cannot wait!! did you go?
Bot: I did It was fantastic

User: may I ask where?
Bot: Brisbane It was english speaking, unfortunately but I had a great time

User: where is brisbane?
Bot: Australia

User: WOW! That is fantastic!!
Bot: any ideas where you want to go??

User: I am just at the point that I want to go! I do not care where or what language, I just want to be where I am meant to!
Bot: that's a good attitude I wish I was like that I cried when I got my call because I was so convinved that I was going to go to Korea I was really dissapointed

User: But I bet, you would never trade that experience for anything! I mean going to Australia and all that
Bot: yeah for sure I'm glad it was Australia, it was perfect for me hey sorry I have to switch rooms! I might find you on the chat again

User: Hello?
Bot: Hi!!

User: How's it going?
Bot: I am doing good!! How about yourself? Kind of a crazy prompt! Scary to think of that happening. I have recently had the impression that we NEED other people to survive and thrive. I dont think I could last long.

User: That is a good question! I think I would talk aboutTreating people how you want to be treated. Seems to be a concept that we can all improve on.
Bot: Oh jeez

User: What would you talk about? And how is your day going today?
Bot: Cant go wrong with the golden rule.

User: That is true! Thats why they call it golden!
Bot: haha Just been doing some projects today you?

User: I studied for a test and went to class. Thats about it. What are you projects for?
Bot: Graphic design stuff

User: That is so cool! My wife loves graphic design. How long have you been doing it?
Bot: I got started with the graphic design merit badge way beck when and it kinda clicked

User: Wow I didn't know there was a merit badge for that. That is so cool! So are you in the major here at BYU? How much longer do you have left in the program if you are?
Bot: The minor. I am in the animation pre major

User: Oh I see. That is awesome. I wish I knew how to do some of that stuff. All I'm good at is math, science, and baking. Do you want to work for Disney or Pixar?
Bot: So youre an engineer?

User: No, I'm Pre Dental! But I like engineering I want to learn how to do that too! Sometimes It's hard for me to make up my mind haha.
Bot: How did you end up pre dental?\

User: Long story short, I interviewed people from my hometown and found out that I liked dental stuff. Then I just started taking classes and going farther into it and now here I am I just applied to school this summer. So I'm just waiting to hear back from them.
Bot: ok Do you want to go full dds or dental assistant?

User: Yeah Full DDS and I actually would like to go on and specialize in Orthodontics if possible. I just love the whole wire bending teeth straighting thing. *Straightening.
Bot: YOu enjoy the pain of adolescents? haha

User: Haha that is funny! Not really but I like working with kids! the biology and physics behind how it works is really cool too.  Did you have braces as a teenager?
Bot: I did. They werent too bad. I used my rubber bands religiously

User: I've been told that is the hardest part of the job is reminding people to wear their rubber bands. So good job! You made your orthodontist's job easier haha.
Bot: So do you want to start your own practice or work under an old experienced person or work your way up?

User: One day I would like to start my own practice. But I would probably want to start working for someone else first to get experience and pay the student loans off
Bot: Right that a doctor so I bet it costs an arm and a leg. Or a full set of teeth.

User: Yeah seriously! It's very expensive to go to school for it. But the investment pays off if you work hard. It's like instead of investing to start a business you are investing in your education.
Bot: You only need to fix like 6 kids to pay it off(If you keep 100%)

User: I think you would need a little more than that! Like roughly estimating 6 sets of braces would be 30,000$ if you kept 100% but the students loans are going to be way more than that. They will be in the 100's of thousands.
Bot: oh wow. #notjelly

User: haha what does that hashtag mean I've never heard it before. I'm kinda out of the social media game.
Bot: not jealous

User: Oh haha! Thats funny! Yeah I have no idea what the modern slang is nowadays.
Bot: us younguns

User: When did you graduate high school?
Bot: 15

User: Oh so you are only 2 years younger than me I graduate in 13 Its crazy how fast things can change in only two years though
Bot: Especially today. The tech you buy today is almost obsolete tomorrow.

User: I know right. It's crazy. Like you need to be rich to keep up with the trends. Speaking of tech though, there are some really cool things happening in the world that I wish I could be apart of. have you heard of Hyperloop?
Bot: i havent

User: It's like this really fast magnetic levitation train inside a low pressure tube. Imagine being able to travel from LA to Sanfrancisco in 30 minutes. That is something that will be available in the near future. Hopefully.
Bot: *whistle* Is there any effect from the g forces?

User: No because as long as you dont accelerate too fast or turn too sharply then it will just feel like a normal plane or car ride. If you have time to watch their videos on youtube you totally should. they are really doing some cool things. It's going to change the world. Because like if you live in LA but can get to SanFran in 30 minutes for work it totally changes the idea of what a city really is.
Bot: Like those space x guys that are selling tickets to the hotel in space

User: Exactly! Thats another thing that is happening right now! Except I'm not sure who would buy a ticket to a hotel in space because it's like $200,000 just for one ticket.
Bot: You can be an ortho or you can sleep in space for one night.

User: Yeah haha I pick Orthodontist.
Bot: The wife is calling. Gtg Thanks for chatting. Good luck with the prize and dental school.

User: Hello!
Bot: wussup!

User: Nothing much, how are you?
Bot: oh just working and got nothign to do so here I am haha

User: Nice. So what if the world was peanut butter ?
Bot: that would be hard

User: Yeah
Bot: everything sticky

User: I don I don
Bot: and Im not a big fan of PB

User: I don't even know how it would work I like peanut butter, but everything? I mean How would life live
Bot: ......

User: Maybe super smooth peanut butter
Bot: lol dude I would die

User: And we could build with the chunky stuff
Bot: I cant eat PB without a drink

User: Maybe they would allow, like, smoothies with peanut butter So what would you like the world to be made of? Just one thing Or maybe two
Bot: one thing hmmm thats hard lol wood

User: Nice That's a good choice Cus wood can be alive that opens up possibilites
Bot: man you are a thinker I jsut said wood because I like wood but you are like its sustainable and stuff

User: Well, I woodn't think of myself that way
Bot: lol good one

User: So why do you like wood?
Bot: sustainability for one and they are everywhere and are beautiful all wood is unique

User: That's cool.
Bot: color, smell, and the structure are all fun so I think buildings woodn't get bored ;)

User: I think that's a universally like thing, and really beautiful. But it's interesting, because I don't think many people would think of it At least I woodn't have liked*
Bot: hahaha yeah totally if you could play only one video game for the rest of your life what would you play

User: Uh I have to think about this
Bot: take your time I know its hard haha

User: It would have to be a multiplayer or co-op game, so I could play with friends
Bot: ok so what game would that be

User: Probably an rts, like supreme commander Ooh, or starcraft because then I could get really good, and make money off of this curse
Bot: starcraft is dead tho

User: Fine Dota
Bot: mmmm

User: Do people still play dota?
Bot: good choice not really people are also moving out of League

User: Where are the big gaming bucks these days?
Bot: Fortnite definitely

User: Ah, yes
Bot: EVERYONE is doing fornite, streamers, youtube

User: I could become a great streamer
Bot: this streamer named Ninja makes 500k+ streaming just Fortnite

User: Dang
Bot: dude I'd support  your stream

User: I'll be honest
Bot: and thats a month 500k a MONTH

User: Even if I played constantly I probably would never be as good as him I'd just tire of fortnite, and just never play video games agian Hey, thanks for chatting, but I've got to go.
Bot: nice chating with you

User: Have a good life
Bot: thanks

User: Definitely not turn into Voldemort.
Bot: hahaha are you into harry potter at all?

User: I recently watched them all with my husband when we should have been prepping for finals, so it's just been on my mind haha. I have read all the books, I just wouldn't call myself a crazy fan. What about you haha?
Bot: I read all of the books pretty early on I think it was 5th grade when i finished the series I really enjoyed it a lot! It all started with me watching the movie to begin with, then i decided i couldn't wait for the next movie so i went a started to read the series

User: Haha, that is so great! I remember the books would come out, we had a pecking order for who got to read them in what order. Since I was on the younger end, I always got things spoiled *eye roll* What other things do you really like?
Bot: well aside from reading i like to play volleyball and i like to learn honestly I love being at byu I have been learning so much, it is awesome! My major is in applied and computational mathematics, what is yours?

User: That is really awesome! Human Development :) BYU is so good at giving us a rounded education.
Bot: Yeah it is, how long have you been studying that major?

User: I'm a Jr now, but it's a fast program, so only about a year :) I should be done in a year. How much do you have left in your chosen major?
Bot: i have 3 years remaininf a lot of math but it all makes sense when you really think about it and that is what i love about math it is like a massive language of logic and logical statements are ALWAYS true or false so there is little room for doubt

User: My husband took Math 302 and it sounded awful! But something about math is that, like you said, there is a lot of surety. Like, it is what it is.
Bot: yeah i love that about math i am never put in a situation where the teacher has said something illogical if they do you can prove it to them after class and they can reason with you to explain why your proof is wrong or is correct

User: Exactly. The rules are there to be obeyed, and unless there really is something erroneous about it, you can count on there being a solution.
Bot: yeah exactly there is alwayss a way to break things down into simple math reasoning and math are intetwined, one cannot exist without the other, and reasoning is best expressed in the language of math and boolean logic ... at least as far as i can t

User: But I haven't taken math since Stats my sophomore year. But I liked Stats because I felt like that was more of the math I would use in every day life.
Bot: yeah stats is really applicable even if it can be hard to think through sometimes

User: Oh for sure. My husband remembered it all from AP stats his junior year of High School, so I basically had a personal tutor,  so I was lucky
Bot: do you like studio c at all?

User: I watched it more a few years ago, but yeah, I do like it :)
Bot: sometimes i dont know what to think some of the satire on byu dating is funny but slightly disturbing it makes me cringe and laugh at the same time!

User: I agree. They for sure hit things right on the nose, which is so sad. There is such a different culture and expectation here.
Bot: yeah it is different for sure i am going to have a girlfriend here one of these days and i wont care hahaha

User: Yeah, you'll be breaking out of the statistics ;)
Bot: hahaha i love reading about byu dating statistics it reveals so many really weird cultures honestly byu is unlike any other university in the world when it comes to relationships it is honestly kind of messed up and everyone is a returned missionary

User: But I am evidence that that can be avoided. My husband look at it and it's honestly so ridiculous. People just expect too much and you won't find a perfect guy or girl, so we just have to learn what we can deal with and take a leap of faith, so to speak.
Bot: yeah that is true even people you think are a perfect match secretly still have doubts and fears

User: For sure. As humans, I feel like it is impossible to know every possible things about anyone or anything before we get into it. That is why we are able to adapt- we are forced *forced to
Bot: yeah but adapting is change and change is life and it is what makes life worth living without change we would all still be vicious animals who can't follow simple rules and are unreasonable and childish

User: True that! I am so grateful we can change. It would be so weird to learn things through life experience gained, but then not be able to apply it.
Bot: would you go back in time and make life easy if you had the chance or would you rather keep your bad memories as experiences to forever remember and learn from?

User: Y'know, I've thought about that before. Though I do not like some of the bad things that I have done or have had happen to me, I feel like wouldn't be ME if it weren't for those things. And I'm not very inclined to what to meet or be the person I COULD have been. Y Whoops.
Bot: i think all of my mistakes are correctable and although i am sad i have to live with consequences in my life because of those decisions i wouldnt chance going back and perhaps not being able to overcome my weaknesses then perhaps i wouldnt be the person i am today

User: That makes total sense. I am not an avid gamer, but I do understand the reference.
Bot: yeah hey deep questiong what makes good good and evil evil?

User: Hmm Are you meaning definition-wise, or who decides what is good and evil? How about you state your opinion first so I understand, then I will formulate mine :)
Bot: i have a theory my theory is that all things good are good because they create and evil things are evil because they detroy evil things are easy because destruction is the natural tendency of the universe if you have ever studied anything about entropy it kind of makes sense

User: Wow, that was far deeper than anything I was thinking. I think that, in some ways, good is good because we decide it is. We create was is socially acceptable as good. Same for bad. But I mean, we also have the Bible and other scriptures and prophets teach us what basic things are good and how to recognize it, and what things are evil and how to recognize them too
Bot: i think there are some things that we are commanded to do that are just by their nature to complicated to recognize a creative outcome but i always assume that there is some creative outcome higher up the ladder should everyone follow those laws sometimes it only works in cumulative o or in hindsight

User: Well, this is all rather complex and complicated for my brain after a full day of classes hahaha
Bot: hahaha well a lot of people believe that good is what you decide it is and that just wont cut it that will always result in  a clash of beliefs

User: Yeah
Bot: and i also believe that true good actions dont need to use bad actions in the process, so in the end, bad should be eliminated completely hopefully maybe this is way to abstract but that is what i excel at sometimes

User: That is good :) I believe it is good to look at things from unique perspectives because we can find clarify that way, but sometimes it can just also be too confused and distracting :)
Bot: sometimes a unique perspective is the perspective we have been missing all along maybe we just all need a paradigm shift but that is very unlikely to happen in less than 100 years to be honest

User: hello
Bot: Hey good evening Jared

User: ok
Bot: I have some fun provocative favts to share with you

User: honestly, I think if our politicians put more effort into improving the environment, the world would be such a better place world peace is my number 1 priority that's why I'm in marketing to change the world like cotopaxi
Bot: Ok not bad. How should they go about changing things?

User: questival

Bot: Yeah just this last weekend! either working, ooooor flying down to california for my buddy's wedding. I havent decided yet  I want to go, and he wants me to be a groomsman, but its expensive ya know?

User: oh cool! where do you work? <3
Bot: Have you ever heard of Scheels?

User: yeah! outdoor store right?
Bot: Yes ma'am! I'm a sales associate for them. It's kind of far, but they give their employees a BOMB discount. So its 100% worth it  I just barely got decked out with a bunch of rockclimbing gear for way cheap!

User: yoo! that's sweet! how much of a discount do you get? do you rock climb a lot?
Bot: Depends on what I'm buying, but anywhere from 40-60%. I try to. I've got a pass called Freeplay that's basically a pass to a whole bunch of gyms. So sometimes I get distracted and go to other places like Lowe's Xtreme Air Sports. You ever been?

User: YES!! I love Lowe's summer semester we went like every weekend
Bot: It's freaking bomb. I went the other day and FINALLY leaned how to do a double flip on the tramp  Are you gonna be going to school spring semester?

Bot: Peace out!

User: i'm not familiar enough with either of their work to make a good informed decision
Bot: Hey Victoria :) I like them both. I play violin (not that well) but I love turning on piano guys while I study.

User: hey haha yes piano guys are so good!
Bot: I really like their "Secrets" cover and the Star Wars one.

User: yes secrets is one of my favorites! i don't listen to them very often, usually i end up listening to vocal point or something instead
Bot: Is that the men's vocal group?

User: What's my favorite smell? What kind of question is that? I guess I really like the smell of fresh baked cookies and apple pie And if ice cream were a smell I would love that too. What is your favorite smell?
Bot: I think i like the smell of vanilla Theres just something, I dont know, really comforting about it

User: Dude yeah. Vanilla is great Cinnamon too
Bot: Nah, Im not a big fan of cinnamon to be honest

User: Also, new leather. Like a baseball glove Those smells are great
Bot: Cool. Im not the biggest fan of those, but I everyone is different, am i right?

User: You are right. Do you like any sports? To play or watch?
Bot: Yeah, I really like to play Volleyball. I am also a fan of Indoor soccer.

User: Both of those are fun.
Bot: what about you?

User: Indoor soccer is great. Do you enjoy playing with or without walls?
Bot: Definitely with the walls.

User: I enjoy soccer. I used to play goalie. And then I broke my wrist and I kind of lost it from there. Yeah with the walls is my favorite. You can hit it off them and it's so much faster paced. I also did track.
Bot: Yep, thatll do it. Ive never actually broken a bone before. I guess Im kinda lucky And yeah, thats why I like the walls too! it adds a whole new dynamic to the game

User: Yeah. I kept playing for a month before I knew it was broken. So...that wasn't very fun. You are super lucky for not having broken a bone haha Yeah. I enjoyed being the goalkeeper and turning to the wall and kicking it off the wall to the opposite end of the field. Well, half court or else the referee got mad
Bot: I guess im not as athletic as most people. haha

User: No?
Bot: Wow, you guys played hardcore! thats awesome!

User: I love being active but with studies it makes it really really hard I didn't say we won any of the games... Because we lost them so bad. So we messed around a ton. The score would be like 1-8 or 2-9.
Bot: Yeah, it seems like it. That sounds a lot like my ultimate frisbee team we love playing, but we are actually really bad.

User: That's awesome!
Bot: Like the last 2 games we had, we lost them both 12-1

User: Frisbee is super fun. Dang, that's a lot of points to make up. To win back might be a better way of expressing that
Bot: Oh yeah, for sure. It was pretty much impossible

User: But still fun I'm sure.
Bot: so what are your hobbie besides sports?

User: Not school. I guess I play the bass which can be fun. But it's been a while. You? Video games are fun but I never play.
Bot: I love to write music. Or i guess just music in general. I thinks its awesome!

User: I guess listening to music can be a hobby of mine too. What instruments do you play? Piano I assume?
Bot: So I like to play piano and guitar. And i like to sing But its the creation process that really gets me going Writting music is so much fun

User: That's cool!
Bot: haha, its like exercise for your soul

User: I'm so bad at writing music.
Bot: that sounds pretty dumb, but thats what it feels like

User: I've tried a bit. I leave it to other people. That feeling makes sense. It's fulfilling.
Bot: Yeah, And i dont even think it has to be music. Just doing something to get your thoughts outside of yourself is really healthy I dont know, Im kinda in to all the hippie stuff I got to go! Thanks for chatting

User: Bacon would be a lot more expensive. You would have to have a enclosed cage for your pigs. Hello?
Bot: Hi ranger How're you doing today? If they could fly I would total ride one If I respond like off and on it's because I'm walking on campus right now and chatting from my phone

User: Freshly baked homemade cookies!
Bot: That's a good one. I like the smell of pine candles.

User: What are those?
Bot: It's just a candle with the smell of pine trees?

User: Oh, I understand. That would smell nice!
Bot: It does. It smells like being on a mountain. What do you like doin for fun?

User: I enjoy that smell! I am from a rural town, so I enjoy fresh air. I enjoy hiking and reading. My husband used to ballroom dance, so I enjoy dancing with him. Now that finals are over for me, I will hopefully have more time to do actually Have free time. What about you? What do you enjoy doing?
Bot: I like exercising and spending time with my family. Sometimes is hard because of school, but now I am done with finals as well, so I will have more time to spend with them and doing fun things.

User: Congratulations for finishing finals! I also enjoy spending time with my family and exercising. I ran cross country in high school, but now it is hard to find time to run that Many miles each day. What type of exercise do you like to do?
Bot: I also ran cross country in high school. Now I don't run as much, but I still exercise almost every day. I use some DVDs and I go to the gym on campus. I just took a weight lifting class this semester and it was a great class. I had fun doing that.

User: Good for you! I weight lifted in high school and really enjoyed it. It was neat to see how it helped me run faster in races. Do you have a favorite exercise dvd?
Bot: I use the 21 day fix, and if I want to do something specific I use some on youtube. What is your major?

User: YouTube has a surprising amount of good exercise videos! I am a Russian major. What is yours?
Bot: Wow Russian! That sounds like a hard major. I study dietetics.

User: That also sounds like a hard major! But a very useful one. What do you wish to do with it?
Bot: I want to be a school district dietitian, but before that work in a clinical setting. I hope that I will only work as clinical dietitian for a few years I want to help students and teachers to have healthy lifestyles with physical activity and nutrition

User: that is awesome! I did not know that school districts had dietitians. I feel that is something every district needs. So many teachers and students need that type of help.
Bot: Not all of the districts have. But I agree that it is important. I feel like our generation is focusing on working, making money, and forgetting about nutrition and other important things. What do you want to do with your major? Do you want to work with international relations? Teach?

User: I like vanilla
Bot: I love the smell of mint! Or laundry detergent haha

User: dude I love laundry detergent I always get the urge to eat it ya know
Bot: Oh no  that was a terrible joke

User: #tidepodchallenge
Bot: #justsayno This boy in my class just gave a 10 minute presentation on the ethical problems of the tide pod challenge and I really had to force myself not to cry of laughter the whole Time

User: haha that sounds hilarious also why is there even a ethical debate on that it's just stupid
Bot: It was awful What is your favorite food?

User: crepes with the nutella and the strawberries yummm
Bot: AND WHIPPED CREAM! Whipped cream is always the best part

User: Hello! Hows it going?
Bot: Awesome, I am talking to you. Dude I have to get to one million five hundred thousand points before tomorrow so that I can get my name into the raffle twice. I am down like seven hundred thousand points so I got to start talking like a crazy man.

User: Yup! We got to chat more! Its ok, you can still do it!
Bot: And I played overwatch today with an actual mouse and it works. There is like no lag. The graphics suck, but it is playable so that is good.

User: Thats great! I have actually really developed a love for Overwatch!
Bot: The problem is that now I actually need to probably buy overwatch and that is not super expensive, but I have to figure it out. I need a friend to give me a humble bundle too. Hvae you been playing it a lot?

User: Its a First person shooter that I can figure out Haha, ya. I havent really played it a ton. Just on the weekends when I was at your house and one time with my roommate Actually might have been twice with my roommate. I think I played a little on sunday
Bot: So I'm actually at nine hundred thousand points which means I need to earn another six hundred thousand, which is totally doable in one day. The problam is that I only have

User: Ya, you can totally do it! Im not sure if they are ending the raffle tonight or when they are doing it though.
Bot: until like five oclock today because from their I have a homework assignment with a friend that I need to figure out, so that should be a priority, plus I have to do some homework for my bio class, and that is bleh. They are probably going to end it tonight, so I need to get as many points as I can. How many points were you averaging per hour, when you were grinding in order to beat Kyle?

User: sorry about that, my mom called. Anyway, I think I was shooting for a couple hundred thousand an hour. You can still do it honestly though Lets just chat as much as we can! Hey, have you heard the new imagine dragons album?
Bot: You were shooting for a couple hundred of thousand an hour? I bet that is doable, lets go for it. No I haven't is it pretty good? When did they release it.

User: Ya, its pretty good. They just released it just a few days ago Its called origin,
Bot: I've spent a lot of time listening to music from the Video Game Halo to study, so I haven't had much time to listen to other peopl.

User: Its on Spotify too
Bot: Is it like their normal music, or does it change it up a bit? Where did you hear about it?

User: I heard about it from Austin. He told me that they just released one and thats when I was like what is it called. Searched it up and its pretty good. They have a few new styles, but its fairly similar to the past of Imagine Dragons
Bot: Have you been talking to Austin a lot? Are you guys in the same math class? You need to talk him into getting overwatch so that we can play together and have a team, we may be

User: It seems like they don't really mix it up too much but I still like their music
Bot: a sucky team, but we can still be a good team at that. I guess not a good team, but we can still play together from time to time.

User: Haha. Ya, Ill talk to him. I am in the same calc class as him. Its been pretty good. Ill convince him to buy overwatch. I think he would try it. Do you know if he already plays games? He has an HP Spectre, I think it would probably handle it just fine.
Bot: I have no idea, I remember that he remembers when we invited him to my house with everyone to play games together. That was super fun, we need to do something like that again. Did he find his computer, where was it at?

User: That would be fun. He did find it. Apparently the TA from the next hour of class had it but was sick for about a week or something right after, so she just had it at home. Hah But we left his phone number on the chalkboard and luckily she ended up contacting him the next time she was at school Its just crazy that it had been an entire week without it, I was beginning to think that it was gone, and I think he was thinking it too
Bot: Wow, he is super lucky. I'm happy that he could find it. Honestly I feel like the best place to lose a laptop would be BYU, because I feel like a lot of people would be honest and return it. But he still probably got quite a scare out of that. Did he tell the teacher that he had left it, or did you just decide to write on the board?

User: Ya, thats true, but I think there are plenty of people that would still try to steal it here on campus. Haha Even though, its a fairly honest people
Bot: ya it's true, but i like that to think that people would try and remain honest.

User: I just saw chalk right next to us and I told him why don't you just write your name on the blackboard, maybe someone will see it and call you. I thought it was a fail, because last week no-one called, but finally someone did
Bot: that was a way good idea. Matt you honestly have some brilliant ideas.

User: Thats true. People here would try to be as honest as they can Haha, no, I feel like I just have these kinds of random things that happen to me all the time... Random things just keep you guessing in life Apparently it isn't helping me in my classes though. Haha
Bot: haha, that is true, but then you have cool stuff happen to you all the time, like getting free video games, or winning an ipad pro, but you do have a bunch of random stuff happen to you.

User: Although, I just found out today that our final test score can override our midterm score, so I just have to study a ton to get a good grade on it and then Ill keep my A in the class
Bot: Man, I am slowly working my way up the leaderboard, I am just going to keep doing this until I get to the one million five hudnred thousand mark. I'm already super close to

User: Haha, even the cool stuff, just seems to be really random too! haha
Bot: the million mark. ya, you do have a ton of random stuff happen to you.

User: Ya, you honestly are cruising pretty quick
Bot: So when are we going to go to DisneyLand, Sadie has been wanting to go super bad, so we need to plan it, and start saving so that we can go.

User: Around 2:50 I will have to pause for a quick second just to get to my next class, but I will be able to continue as soon as I get there I have no idea. All I know it is super expensive. haha Both transportation, and entrance to go too! Have you ever been?
Bot: What is your class at 3:00 and is it really that expensive. I think the entrance would be the most expensive. Didn't you say you have a place where we could stay?

User: Ive probably asked that before, but I have clearly forgotten
Bot: Honestly if we just get enough people together then we can carpool down, and it is not that expensive. ya, I've been like three or four times. Have you?

User: I think I have a place that we could stay. I havent talked to him in a long time but Im sure that he would still be down for it. I have never been, but all Ive heard is that is a few hundred dollars just to get in.
Bot: That would save us a ton of money. I think its like a hundred bucks for a two day pass.

User: But that might be for California Adventures and DisneyLand Oh, really! I didn't know it was that cheap. Maybe next summer would be perfect to go. Also I might be interning over there anyway.
Bot: Ya, it's one hundred dollars for two days with a park hopper pass between Disneyland and California adventures.. That's about the same price as buying a ticket to lagoon.

User: That is about the same price, I just thought the people over there were telling me that it was more expensive than that. But thats awesome!
Bot: Ya, its way cheap, the expensive part is getting down there. But honestly if we get enough people in a car then we are good to go.

User: Ya, we should get a group to go down. Oh, hey, I was just checking it out online. It is 93 dollars for 3 days
Bot: I mean cass and Hayden would always be down to go.

User: But the 93 dollars is each day so it actually comes out to be just under 300 dollars
Bot: Oh, jk, that's the price per day. So a two day ticket is like 200 which honestly is not bad. It would be worth it.

User: and if you want to have a park hopper pass, then you add around 20 a day, but ya, thats not too bad for 2 days
Bot: I mean, that would be way fun. We should totally do it.

User: Ya, next summer I think it would be the best time. Although I really don't know everything about busy schedules or anything Ive heard that the first time that you go it is just a really magical experience, so we have to go at least once, but Ive also heard that after the first time its not anything
Bot: When will you hear about your internship/

User: more special than any other theme park
Bot: The will probably be a big factor in if we can do it.

User: I don't know yet, I havent even applied yet. Haha
Bot: Honestly maybe they will pay for your apartment and then we can just come crash with you, and go to disneyworld.

User: Ya, the places that im looking at all say they will pay for my apartment, as well as pay super nice! Haha That might work out perfect Thats just if I get it. But if I don't, I will try again for the next years year
Bot: Ya, that would be way chill, so now you just have to make sure that you actually get the internship. You better start submitting your application.

User: Yup! Then we can just party down there and go to the beach and stuff I would, Im just doing all my homework, thats keeping me busy as is. But I plan on putting my portfolio and things together in this next month I know its going to get crazy though academically, just because every class wants to wrap things up at the end of the semester, but Im trying to get ahead, so that I can focus on my portfolio and internship submission papers
Bot: I am looking forward to thanksgiving where I can just focus on all my homework and try and get caught up in everything that I am behind on.

User: The main disadvantage is the fact that Im not a diverse person. I have nothing that I can show off about me other than my skills. haha
Bot: Ya, you do have a good chance, i feel like youre animations are way good.

User: Ya, thanksgiving is going to be a great time. By that time, I will have an iPad and you will have a MacBook Pro, just chugging away at our homework. haha Ya, I think I just need a demo reel to show it off more. I need motion of things that I have created. Like a video that tears my 3D art apart step by step and shows my process of creation I hear and see how much of an advantage that gives you as you are applying to jobs
Bot: ya right, I honestly doubt that i will get the macbook. I never win anything. If anything you will win both of them, just because I feel like you are super lucky like that.

User: People can see the incredible work that you do, but really they are more interested in how you ended up makingit making it
Bot: I honestly can see you getting both of them. i will get pizza:)

User: That would be super sweet though, either way I will get pizza too! honestly im just in it for the pizza. haha
Bot: Haha if you got both of them that would be super sweet:) It would be ridiculous.

User: I would be super happy, and that would make my semester a little less of a sad one. haha. Just feels like ive been so bogged down by everything this past semester, that would be great if I could end up winning both. But I would be super happy if you won one too Are you at work right now?
Bot: Haha, ya, I think it would be fun to win, but the chances are pretty small. I'm at work, but I'm not on the clock.

User: Oh gotcha, are you doing homework too?
Bot: Ya, I'm trying to get caught up so we can go see a movie tonight. We bought tickets for the grinch.

User: The chances may be small, but they exist! Oh, thats right, Sadie was really wanting to see that. haha
Bot: ya, she is way excited so we are going to see it.

User: That will be fun. Hey, just a quick question. Do you have two keyboards and two mice for your work setup? Or do you have one set configured to work with both
Bot: I have two, but I run a program called synergy that acts as a server, so I really only use one to do all my work. Hey Dude, I am way close to the million mark, and I did one hundred thousand in about half an hour, i think that this is totally possible. I just have to push, and make sure

User: Oh gotcha that makes sense, I just remembered you saying that you somehow only use one set and I was wondering if you had any easy solutions for me
Bot: That I type a lot, so that i can reach the mark.

User: Do you know if synergy works on linux Ya, you are almost to the million mark!
Bot: I honestly have no idea, but you can probably give it a shot

User: Ya, I might check it out. Oh hey, I think I found it. Oh, man it costs money. haha
Bot: Does it? It might, I know that they have it for us here on campus, so I use it. How much does it cost?

User: It costs like 20 dollars, thats not bad, but I think I can find an open source alternative for it. Not to mention open source things seem to work better on linux. I think its just a community thing
Bot: You probably can, i honestly really like synergy. What do you want it for?

User: I just have multiple computers at home, and I only really have one keyboard. Its just a pain to have more than one keyboard My mouse switches between two different computers already, but I just havent bought the matching keyboard that does the same thing yet. I think that is what I want to get eventually though. Those keyboards are really nice I think. It practically does the same thing as synergy, but just doesn't require software for it, as it is a physical switch
Bot: ya, that makes sense. Maybe you could buy a keyboard that has two usb hubs so that everything that you type in on one computer automatically gets typed on the second compuer. That would be a way good idea, and I think that that would solve your problem. Are you just worried about having a mouse and keyboard for your laptop and your desktop or what are you thinking about?

User: Haha. Maybe especially if I want to type something more than once. But I think the ones with switches are pretty nice Ya, like when I dock my laptop, its docked with its lid closed, so you don't use the keyboard.
Bot: that is way cool, how much does a keyboard like that cost? Is it pretty cheap, or will it run you a couple of hundred of dollars?

User: I mean, you can leave it open, but its just in a bad position to use the keyboard, but if I had a keyboard that allows me to switch between two different pcs that would be awesome Its like 70 or so Its not too bad, but the only bad part is the fact that its wireless.
Bot: thats not too bad. I mean keyboards are already pretty expensive. Is it a mechanical keyboard or is it something else/ why don't you just buy rechargeable batteries. That is what I did for my xbox.

User: I think there are a couple of different types of them. Im looking at one from Logitech and I can't remember Ya, I could end up doing that. Oh actually I just looked up the multi device Logitech keyboard and it is only 50 dollars
Bot: That's not even bad, maybe when you get your ipad you can just sell it and then buy your keyboard.

User: and it comes with a phone and tablet holder. Haha
Bot: that sounds like a great deal;)

User: Haha, ill sell the iPad to you for 800 dollars. Do you want it? It would be a great Christmas present. ill even give you a 50 dollar friend discount, that will knock it down to a bleeding 750 dollars Haha
Bot: I will buy it off of you for 600$ final offer;) with the discount that should be 550.

User: Hmmmm.........
Bot: Sounds like a great bargain For you. I would even be so kind as to take it off of your hands for free. That sounds like it would be a great deal.

User: Eh.... I think Ill keep it. Although, thats not a bad offer.
Bot: I will trade you a macbook pro for it.

User: Really? Im down! deal!
Bot: Yes, a 2008 macbook pro. Done deal. No takebacks

User: Oh, shoot! do you have a 2008 MacBook Pro?
Bot: Yes. No. but I will buy one just for the trade.

User: Haha. I think I will actually pass now, sorry, we didn't shake on it Cant seal the deal if there isn't a signature
Bot: No, you gave me your word. Plus I can get it on ebay for like 25 250 and I have proof. I took a screenshot of this chat.

User: My word will disappear after I hit end chat so..... Oh shoot! Haha
Bot: I took the screenshot.

User: Prove it
Bot: Your words have now been immortalized in the pixels of my phone camera.

User: haha Also, how good is the pixels of your camera
Bot: I think it's like a 12 megapixel camera, but don't quote me on that. I am probably wrong? Honestly the pixels don't matter though. The sensor is a bigger deal. That's why the apples only have like 12 megs.

User: I just took a snapshot, I can now hold those lies against you I decided to quote you on that Haha
Bot: Ok, that's fine as long as you give me the ipad:)

User: Ok, give me a second to get to my next class and I will log back in. But Im not going to end the chat yet though Nope, you lied to me, and I lied to you now we are even. Haha
Bot: Ok thats, fine I will just write a ton of suprises for you, so that when you open the chat you can have some random facts. Did you know that banging your head against a wall for an hour burns 150 calories. That's pretty interesting, even though it's painful. are you almost at your next class?

User: I just got here Dang! Maybe Ill try that Initiating head banging, now! Are you still there?
Bot: yes, I am on. I never left, I was just waiting for you to get to your class.

User: Sweet! Im just in CS224
Bot: What class are you in right now?

User: gotcha!
Bot: That's way cool. Is everyone in the class struggling. Was this last test hard on everyone?

User: I dont know yet. I think we are all struggling, but thats probably just me. haha The test hasnt been graded We are learning about physical gates on the computer Its blowing my mind!
Bot: What are you learning about them? I think that is going to be like one of my next classes. Are you  talking about and gates and or gates and nor gates and nand gates?

User: Yup, its pretty cool, just feel like im about to die in class. haha No, thats just me being dramatic. Its honestly not that bad, but you have to follow exactly what is going on, or you might miss everything. The gates all rely on each other
Bot: Ya that is how my next class is going to be for this upcoming semester. It's going to be super complicated, but i'm kind of excited for it. I heard that the class is hard but whatever. My teacher was talking about it in our seminar class, and it seemed pretty interesting.

User: Ya, you'll like it. Thats actually what you want to end up doing anyway isnt it?
Bot: I don't really now. Maybe I will fall in love with it, and that will be what I want to do. Or maybe I will hate, it and never want anything to do with it ever again. I will just have to see what happens. I am totally open to whatever happens. I 'm just here to explore

User: Ya, hopefully you'll like it. I can see you really liking it. At least what I've learned so far is really cool, just complicated, and I think you will like it You could be a hardware developer and I could be a software developer and we could take down microsoft and apple and google with our crazy designs that everyone will love
Bot: Ya, how every gate returns a 1 or a 0, and then they have these huge complicated groupings of them, and it makes things happen. I do think that it is pretty interesting. I don't think two guys can take down google. I feel like those days are gone.

User: no, dont give up on me! We can do this! We will team up with others then after we take down google we will betray everyone and shutdown all other business Those days arent dead. We will be the next Google
Bot: Haha, I like how you threw in the betray everyone. That makes the business plan seems much more cut throat, and therefore i approve of it.

User: Yes, so youre in? Haha
Bot: Haha, sure what the heck why not.

User: Thats the attitude I like to see. World domination here we come!
Bot: Or maybe, just the tri-state area.

User: Ok, well... I guess we do have to start small but eventually world domination!
Bot: Haha, I am so frusturated with my math.

User: What math do you have right now? or are you talking about the math in your physics
Bot: No, linear algebra, the problem is that their are like a hundred small computations in each problem, so by the time you finish the problem, and then you get it wrong, it takes forever to go back through, and find out where your problem was.

User: Oh, I get you! That does sound like a headache Good luck! I hope you dont get too frustrated
Bot: Ya, i have been working on this last problem for the last twenty minutes, the problem is that I haven't been super focused just because I have been messaging you. honestly chit chat makes it kind of hard to stay on top of your homework, and what is really important.

User: If it makes you feel any better, I feel similarly about my cs224, cs235, and calc class. I kind of feel like im so far into the class, but I really want to retreat!
Bot: I'm just gonna rip through this chit chat thing because I also am going to work on a cs 142 class lab, and that is going to take like three hours tonight, so that's frusturati You could have withdrawn if you wanted too;)

User: Oh that is a little bit of an issue. if you do need to finish your homework go ahead Withdrawn from what? Oh, from my classes last night. Ya, but then I lose scholarship and fafsa money
Bot: Why would you have lost your scholarship? And I don't think that you would have lost Fafsa money, you would have just had to have retaken the class.

User: No you lose scholarship and fafsa money because you have less credits Its not because you withdraw, but an effect of withdrawing would be less credits which disqualify you from money haha
Bot: Oh, I did not know that. What scholarship do you have right now? Is is offered from BYU? Or did you get it from some other location? Do you have to maintain a certain Grade Point average in order to keep your scholarship?

User: I have an academic scholarship from BYU and you have to maintain a high Grade Point Average and attend 14 credits Its kind of a bad deal, but I still do it for money anyway
Bot: Oh, no wonder you are so worried about your GPA, I would be too. How high of a GPA do you have to maintain? And 14 credits is quite a bit. well I guess it's not to much, but it's definently a healthy amount.

User: Ya, its about what I would want credit wise, but you have to maintain a 3.7 or 3.8 or so
Bot: That is pretty high, what is your GPA right now?

User: Its like around 3.7 I think. But if I keep getting A minuses it will just slowly sink lower and lower
Bot: An A- is like a 3.7 isn't it? So you are trying to buffer you're grade with as many A's as you can

User: Is it or is 3.5
Bot: That is a good idea. It will probably help you out a ton.

User: I dont know for sure
Bot: I doubt that it's a 3.5 because a 3.0 is a b. so a b+ is probably like a 3.35

User: Ya, Im trying to buffer it as much as I can
Bot: That's probably a really good idea. that will help you in the future. \ I'm already past one million and one hundred thousand. So i'm moving up in the world.

User: Ya, I think I'll be ok, especially if an A minus is actually not as low as I thought it ws was You are moving up. Only 4 hundred thousand more!
Bot: An A- is a 3.7 I just looked it up.

User: Sweet! So I have around an A- Grade Point Average! I'll just keep trying to get it higher and higher.
Bot: Ya, that's what it looks like. It makes sense that they would just expect you to be an A student.

User: I also found out that the Computer Science major is more liberal about giving out scholarships to people. So I actually might get more this next year Ya, that does make sense
Bot: ya, you should work on getting that, I bet that will help you out a ton.

User: Ya, I plan on it. Hey, wanna do something really fun? Its part one of taking over the world And theres cash involved Mucho Dinero!
Bot: What do you have in mind? I love free money I like it even more when i don't have to work for it, but keep talking, I'm interested.

User: I just got an email from BYU saying that there is an app competition It would require a little work, but theres 15000 dollars on the line
Bot: So what is your idea then? Are you wanting to build an app? I'm down, i don't know much, but what the heck, lets do it..

User: its divided up into a few teams but first place is around 3000 to 4000 dollars depending on how high they value the app
Bot: That's way cool.

User: Ya, lets do it. I dont have any ideas, just saw the competition
Bot: What are the rules?

User: Lets give it some thought though Only one app, and cant be in other teams We can have a team of up to 4 people
Bot: Where are the rules for this application thing?

User: One person has to be a student others dont The rules are on appcomp.byu.edu The kickoff is this thursday
Bot: ok, I will have to go look it up, and see what we can do about it. How long do we have to develop the app?

User: I think it said until march So we dont have a long time. Im thinking a web app. We can have one of them up and running really quick Then we can focus on refining it.
Bot: Let me check out the rules on the web page because I think that will help us figure out more what kind of app they are looking for. I don't know if it has to be related to health, or if it would need to be related to some other specific domain of the app world.

User: ya, thats true. Honestly I havent read through them all. Just read through them briefly to get an idea of what it is I dont think that it has to be related to anything. It doesnt have a topic. At least that I've found
Bot: Hmm, how long would it take to get an app off the ground? I have like no experience with app development, but I am willing to learn.

User: Im not exactly sure either, it would be a learning curve for both of us, but I think we can still do it. Especially because we can just focus on design. Design is half of the product
Bot: We could include sadie on the design portion, and have her run that portion of it.

User: It says that if we can manage to get 50,000 people to view our product we will recieve 2500 dollars cash
Bot: Wow, how would we get 50,000 people to view our product? that would be interesting.

User: Thats true, we could, Im also thinking we should figure out someone who is really good at code. Ya, that is a ton I dont know, we would really need a good idea
Bot: We could include matthew crump, but he's already working on an app. Do you know anyone inside of the CS depatrment that could do that?

User: With some good advertising I was just thinking Matthew Crump too! Is his app going to be cooler than ours though?
Bot: he's doing a family history app, so it's eh:)

User: True, unless its ancestry or family search its of no worth. haha
Bot: The most important part of an app apart from its code is the user interface/design. An ugly app does not get used. It's supposidly sponsered by family history I guess.

User: Exactly, I think we can ace the design and usability Oh, I guess its a 5 out of 10 app then Not quite a 10 out of 10 yet haha
Bot: I'm down to start working on it as a project, I think that could be really fun;0

User: I think in this competition there are going to be a ton of coders but hardly designers. Lets punch them right where it hurts... The Design.
Bot: It would take a lot of extra effort though in order to really get it running right.

User: Ya, even if we dont win much, I think its still an adventure that sounds fun
Bot: I bet some of the apps will be cool, be we can totally give it a shot.

User: The thing is though, if we did a web app, it would be a lot easier and web gets used a ton
Bot: What's the difference between a web app and other apps/

User: Ya there will be some cool apps, im sure, but not as cool as ours Remember ours is the first step to world domination Web apps dont need to be downloaded, and it allows the person to use it without any download on their part
Bot: So we wouldn't have to run it through the play store ?

User: And its faster to develop for me, because I already know a decent good chunk of web design stuff No, we wouldnt have to, but the advantage is the fact that we could always port it to Android or IOS It gets a little tricky to port though.
Bot: Ya, we could most definently do it. The only challening part is the design:) We could make a game:)

User: I think the web platform would be the best way to get started fast. If nothing else it could just be for design and functionality of what the actual app will look like Thats true Games could be fun, but we might want to end up doing it differently than the web then. Web doesnt do games very well. But we could still do something like that We first just need an idea and then we can define the platform and how we are going to push it to production
Bot: Ya, the idea is the tricky part I think.

User: Ya, I have nothing. But to be granted, its only been a total of 20 minutes Haha im leaving class right now
Bot: Ok, where are you going? I'm only like three hundred thousand points away, so I got to keep talking, as much as I can before I have to do other things.

User: I'm still here. Just on my phone now I'm heading home now
Bot: Oh nice, do you have any fun plans for tonight? A hot date maybe? When are we going to go on a double date?

User: I wish. But my only date is with homework
Bot: Have you been asking girls on dates? You got to start looking for a girlfriend man.

User: No. I've been really busy this semester
Bot: No excuses, I want to see results;)

User: I know. I just don't prioritize it yet
Bot: haha, ok thats all good. I understand. Unless....maybe I dont....

User: I'll get married in my own due time
Bot: haha, no rush.

User: I'll find someone.
Bot: you seem very serious now. Dont be sad, get glad, trash bags hello, are you there?

User: Ya I'm just sad Haha. Never mind I just got glad
Bot: So when are we going to trick my wife with the wacom tablet? We need to do it sooner rather than later, in case she doesn't like it, then I can plan for other things, and figure out what I'm going to do.

User: I'm down for this weekend
Bot: We are actually heading home this weekend. We have to do some stuff with Sadie's icee shack.

User: Sorry if I'm a little slow to answer. I just got home. I was driving
Bot: So unless you are going home, that will not work.

User: But not chatting while driving
Bot: Ya, chatting while driving is super dangerous.

User: Oh. When are you leaving? Ya. We don't want to kill anyone
Bot: Uh, I think we are going to be leaving friday night. But I'm not sure, maybe you could come over earlier.

User: Ya. Maybe. What should be the reason why I bring the tablet with me. Should I just have it in my backpack
Bot: Ya, just say that you had taken it to work and were taking it home. That should be a pretty believable excuse.

User: Ya. That's true. Ok. When do you get out of school Or off work
Bot: Around 2 But I will probably have some stuff to do.

User: Ok sweet. I will probably work until then too Oh gotcha We can always do it next Monday or something
Bot: Ya, we can definently figure it out.

User: Yup
Bot: Ok, well I need to end the chat, I'm going to go do homework with a friend. Maybe I can get on a bit later, i will text you when I'm ready. thanks for the help. Only three hundred thousand more to go. I believe that I can do this. I just need to type a bunch, and make sure that I am using a varying and differing vocabulary.

User: Hey
Bot: Haha hello again

User: Haha yes hey
Bot: Whats up?

User: Just driving up north
Bot: Oh cool Where to?

User: Back up to school :P
Bot: Right, is it right that you are from saint george? Or was that someone else?

User: Yeah that is right
Bot: Sweet I remembered something

User: Haha I'm glad you did!
Bot: How long is that drive?

User: Its like 3 hours and 40 minutes
Bot: I could get to another state in any direction if I drove that far from where I live or the ocean

User: Haha guess it's not as big of a state
Bot: Definitely not It just blows my mind every time I hear those travel times Like california, that place is huge

User: That is true, takes up almost the whole west coast
Bot: Basically It has so much diversity in that state, like the lands and environment changes so much going up and down

User: Yeah I don't think I've ever been to northern california
Bot: Its mainly agriculture But it has a more mountains and redwoods as you keep going up then randomly a high desert

User: Yeah I think my family wants to take a trip to the redwoods
Bot: I want to go to the actual redwood forrest one day

User: The actual?
Bot: Well like there are old growth forests, where all the trees are redwoods I have just seen like a couple standing alone

User: Outside of california?
Bot: No, in california. More inland. The forests are closer to the coast

User: Ohh okay
Bot: Yeah But if you ever get the chance, visit Mt Shasta and the area around that It is the most beautiful place I have seen

User: Wow I looked it up, that looks pretty amazing
Bot: It really is, Like the hikes around there are breathe taking If you get a chance look up castle lake It is one of those lakes that is completely clear

User: Haha I can do that right now Oh yeah it was showing some of those pictures before too
Bot: I just love that place We did a hike up there in the summer and in the winter when the lake had completely frozen over That was the first time I had ever seen let alone been on a frozen lake

User: You were on it?
Bot: Yeah we went out on it when It was frozen over It was so cool

User: So it gets pretty cold up there huh
Bot: I think the coldest it got was 4 4 is the number of tacos I want not the amount of degrees it should ever be

User: Where did that come from haha I want four scoops of ice cream :P
Bot: Haha I am hungry I should probably eat at some point I think all I have had are grapes

User: Unless the had a really good reason, that's be weird
Bot: that would be a real turn off for me

User: Like, if they were managing hospitals or something Hahaha
Bot: cringe hahah

User: well done
Bot: thanks my guy

User: Would you or wouldn't you turn them off? I would if it was out of the blue Makes it sound like they're preparing an eminent takeover
Bot: id just freak out to be completely honest

User: Haha I guess it depends on the kind of computer too Like is this a talking computer?
Bot: there are a lot of computer-based starter questions i feek feel

User: A humanoid robot? Yeah Makes you wonder what kind of robot this one will be
Bot: what if computers had the right to vote?

User: The one they're training with this data
Bot: that one doesnt even make sense

User: I don't think that makes sense
Bot: yeah true itll be a confused AI

User: Yeah definitely agree The prompts sound a little like uninformed buzfeed articles haah *haha
Bot: amen to that hahah

User: What are some more interesting prompts?
Bot: thats the most accurate description i've heard of the prompts so far

User: Haha thank you
Bot: i dont remember actually if pets could talk was one of my recent ones

User: Or I mean, if you came up with some, what would they be? Oh yeah, that's a fun one
Bot: that was another buzzfeed type still ohh i see i have no idea im not creative enough

User: Haha
Bot: "What would you do for an ipad pro" a lot -me hahah

User: Hahahaha how long have you been chatting? Do you think you'll get it one of these times ?
Bot: today i haven't been on a bunch

User: It's nice that there's four chances
Bot: but i'll definitely get it at some point yeah for sure

User: Haha I beleive in you
Bot: thanks man hahah

User: I'm honestly just hoping I win the raffle haha
Bot: where are you at point-wise

User: less effort that way
Bot: same!

User: I'm probably not going to win
Bot: a macbook pro would be so clutch

User: I mean it ends today right?
Bot: i think so i dont know what time it ends

User: The first one? Yeah I don't have enough time I've been so busy this week I wish I had time to chat
Bot: yeah same midterms are killer

User: Yup
Bot: last night i had a ton of time so that was nice

User: Yesterday was the most productive time I've had in forever, not because I was productive but because I had a 235 lab due, and two essays
Bot: okay hold up my buddy wants to get to the 300k and nobody else is on so he wants to chat with me

User: So I was VERY productive Haha ok Good luck to him Later!
Bot: i hate to be that guy hahah but hes very adamant that i talk to him hahah

User: oooof that's a big question
Bot: Haha I would make juggling lessons mandatory It's so hard to juggle and I'm learning right now and it's just really difficult I mean, I practiced for 30 minutes today, and it was really strenuous

User: Helllooooo again I could see all your messages but you couldn't see mine :'( or yours apparently
Bot: Haha well now I can

User: Hoooray I wanna know about the road in Hawaii I've never been there and it sounds cool also
Bot: It's in Maui and you drive to this remote little town and on the way there you can stop and hike waterfalls and it's gorgeous

User: oh that's so cool
Bot: Haha voice to text isn't perfect Yeah I really want to go back.

User: I didn't want to go for a long time just because I'm not a big fan of the beach but there seems to be a lot of cool stuff that I could really appreciate in Hawaii
Bot: Open up there's so much more to do in Hawaii other than the beach. You can hike and you can see wildlife and its really really beautiful Haha I said oh but Not open up Ok I'm at the temple now so Ive got to go but it was great chatting with you!

User: Hi! The last film that made an impression on me was probably Infinity War because I just saw it this morning lol
Bot: Haha I have heard many things about that one. What did you think?

User: It was a lot to take in and a reaaally long movie but I liked it I won't say anything else and spoil it for you haha what's your favorite movie of all time?
Bot: Oh I don't know, maybe it's already been spoiled for me. I heard the bad guy wins haha

User: I don't know what my superpower would be. Playing music? I don't know. What are you reall good at?
Bot: Well I play violin and piano (violin is for school), but my secret superpower is I can draw comics pretty well I love Marvel movies so as soon as I saw superpower I got real excited!

User: That's cool.  And we just had the last chat together This happened to me earlier with a different person. Oh my gosh
Bot: Oh no way! I am using my sister's laptop and it has accidentally closed a few of the chats for me so I always felt bad. Sorry! I've talked a lot about Infinity War to people already...

User: It's all good. And hey that's not a bad thing, it's a great movie Also I figured something out about the movie! Theory: Groot isn't dead. Wanna know why?
Bot: MMHMMHM 2 chats in and we're already diving into theories! Go on!

User: Haha. So you know how his arm became the handle for Thor's axe? Well Thor's axe wasn't destroyed after the snap and so it could be just like the first time Groot "died" Right? Haha
Bot: Dang girl you right. This isn't really a theory, but do you remember (of course you probably have this image burned in your head) when homeboy Spiderman died? Well, everyone else who disintegrated didn't really realize that something was happening to them until they were halfway gone

User: Heck ya! That was super sad but I have to be honest I think all the memes that came because of it are super funny
Bot: BUT poor Peter Parker says "I don't feel so good" because he knows something bad is happening because SPIDEY SENSE! YES those memes are gold

User: Oh my gosh I didn't even think about the spider sense! How'd I miss it?
Bot: I can't take credit for that, I read it online when I was busy grieving after the movie.

User: Everyone handles grief differently, I just kept going over the whole movie with the friend I watched it with and that didn't really make it better sadly haha
Bot: I really appreciate the story and depth of character development that you see for all these beloved heroes, but that won't stop me from crying over Gamora and Spiderman

User: Ya me too. It really helped that there were several movies before that all lead up to this, it wasn't just thrown together and didn't cut stuff out that's important. I agree though, it was sadder than I thought it would be. Even Loki dying was sad for me.
Bot: I felt like I was slapped in the face! I mean, I like hopeless tragedies (you're chatting with an English nerd) but not for my superhero squad!

User: Not Spider-Man, at least leave him alive Marvel come on
Bot: I mean we know he's coming back but this movie really was designed to break everything you thought you knew about how movies are done.

User: It definitely accomplished that. I'm anxious to see how Captain Marvel fixes everything
Bot: Marvel keeps one-upping themselves. Even the "bad" or unpopular movies are significantly better than a lot of other ones (@DC)...

User: Oooo take that DC! I'm not a fan of DC movies, especially after I was really let down with Batman vs Superman. They had a lot potential but just ruined it in my opinion
Bot: Yes, with the one exception being Wonder Woman.

User: Oh yes I forgot. That one was their best one but I still like Marvel movies better
Bot: If Marvel got Wonder Woman, DC should just quietly go out of business. Sorry Superman. :(

User: Definitely haha. Maybe that's what captain marvel is for,,
Bot: One day, I will tell my kids about how sad waiting between Marvel movies was while they can watch Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 5 instantly...

User: That would just be weird
Bot: yeah that would be hahahah. I would be like I bought you and I get to turn you off whenever I want! was there ever an event in your life that defied explanation?

User: No not really now that I think about it Hbu?
Bot: hmmm It is when I got hit by a car on my bicycle

User: Wow that's kinda cool
Bot: So i was going home from school right? and I was crossing the intersection because the light was green and this car on the other side was turning and t boned me

User: Not that it hit you but that you survived
Bot: and I flew off the bike straight up and landed on my FEET

User: Dang that's awesome
Bot: my bike was a gonner though it was stuck under the car

User: Yeah I bet Were you hurt at all
Bot: not at all which is why it defied explanation

User: Wow that's awesome So what's your major
Bot: I am studying Information Technology

User: Wow that's cool I'm electrical or mechanical engineering Not sure yet Are you going know a mission
Bot: EE and ME huh? those are tough majors! I already went on a mission. Ive been back like 3 years ish now

User: Oh wow where at?
Bot: I served in Oakland and San Francisco speaking Cambodian what about you?

User: That is super cool. I'm going to Montana :)
Bot: oh wow I've never met anyone going there any languages you are speaking?

User: English Not the most exciting place but I'm super pumped
Bot: nice nice. what makes you super pumped?

User: Just serving a mission you know it's exciting and I'm excited to share the gospel I also lived in the mission for 10 years in Mt and wy so I'm going straight back :)
Bot: hey man I am really proud of you and you have the right mindset going on a mission. that is really the key for the mission or else its going to be hard oh and can I give you another tip that I wish I learned early on on my mission?

User: Yes please
Bot: HAVE FUN please just have a lot of fun and enjoy yourselves and with your companion because sharing the gospel and the mission is all about not just growth for yourself but its fun

User: Alright I definitely will I've heard that from others too so it sounds like some good advice
Bot: yes its a great one that I wish people have told me

User: So how many Cambodian speakers do you usually talk to in a month?
Bot: all the time except they knew english already so it was hard to learn cambodian because I didn't have much practice and opportunity to speak it

User: So do you still speak it at all?
Bot: I can still read it but I need to get warmed up if you know what I mean

User: Yeah I see what you mean
Bot: yeah it was tough to learn but I still loved learning about the culture and the people

User: Yeah for sure I'm hoping to be able to see a lot of the Montana mountains and go hiking a stuff like that
Bot: that would be dope! I want to see other mountains besides the Rocky mountains in Utah. I mean I want to share my love to all the mountains out there because they need it

User: Haha true But I live in the east coast and I'll have to tell you the mountains aren't as cool out here
Bot: oh hahaha whats not so cool about them?

User: I love them both, though I have a preference for Mozart.
Bot: Honestly couldn't tell you the difference between the two

User: They kind of fit into the same category, for sure. I could be totally wrong, but I think of Beethoven as more piano and Mozart as more strings. Though I know that's wrong. Do you listen to classical often?
Bot: I mean I guess I kind of know them both as classical music. Sometimes I put on a classical music in the background when I do homework, but I don't really pay attention to the artist. Do you listen to classical music alot? I think if were talking about this genre of music I'd probably say I like jazz more.

User: I have no idea what I am doing
Bot: hello lol neither do it *i

User: haha we are supposed to talk about science? is that what it said?
Bot: No it was just saying that this is for science

User: na they are pretty generally atheist, but they are all members of the state church as tradition. Made life interesting as a missionary to say the least
Bot: oh thats just like japan! but replace state church with buddhism, but mostly they just believe in themselves

User: yeah umpaloompas man gotta go on a major safari'
Bot: when i was 8 i thought the jumpsuits you get baptized in looked like umpaloompa suits i was so mad i mean, i'm over it now

User: haha wait you were mad that they looked like it and you had to wear one?
Bot: yeah with the whole zipper up the front and everything, i was so angry

User: Man, that'd be weord Weird
Bot: Hey it works now!

User: Yay!!!
Bot: What are you up to?

User: Im watching krull with my family
Bot: What is that?

User: Its really strange let me tell you. I cant see the emoji!!! Ahhhh
Bot: Noooooo

User: Its a tragedy!!!!
Bot: It's popcorn ;)

User: Ooh! Yummy!
Bot: Anyway, go on, what is it?

User: Its a 1983 movie about a princess that got kidnapped at her wedding by weird alien creatures Liam neelson is in it too
Bot: Woah that is kind of strange. Is it good? I am bad with actors but that sounds familiar

User: Yeah! It's similar to the princess bride, and he plays in taken, as the dad Well, similar in a way
Bot: Ahhhh I just looked it up Oh interesting. Is it just the right level of cheesy like princess bride?

User: I used to think it was the princess bride 2 tbh And yeah Its pretty funny
Bot: Perfect. Which came first, krull or princess bride? I feel like the answer is krull...

User: Well, when was the princess bride made?
Bot: That's a good question.

User: I can look it up, one second
Bot: 1987

User: There ya go
Bot: Oh so it did come later.

User: So yeah. Krull was made first
Bot: I still wasn't expecting princess bride to be so old though!!! What's happening?

User: Its not too old! Just 30 years
Bot: Haha, well it is one of the best movies out there. Such a great story!

User: And they just caught wild horses to travel to the black fortrest to save the princess And it really is!!! Its a classic!!!
Bot: Wait the alien fortress?

User: Yeah Its called the black fortrest, and it moves every sunrise
Bot: That's kind of weird. I keep thinking that people didn't believe in aliens back then Well that probably makes things difficult

User: Yeah, well the first ufo sighting was in 1947
Bot: Well I didn't know that

User: Neither did i. I just looked it up.
Bot: I would've guessed even earlier actually I was thinking that people start thinking about aliens along time ago I guess not thats interesting

User: Thats true. But the first well known one was 1947. People think aliens helped build the pyramids though, so maybe earlier for sure.
Bot: Well I guess if they actually exist in the actually did help humans build the pyramids in there probably was a sighting long long before 1947

User: Oh, definitely!
Bot: But if they didn't that the first UFO "sighting " would Probably be sometime around 1947 Oh I just made my bed and it's so clean and fresh and cool and it feels amazing

User: Well, another article said the last 140 years, so 1800s That sounds so amazing!!!
Bot: I got a really cool apartment My roommates are both pretty chill And it's not super crowded One roommate is leaving in a couple weeks

User: That also sounfs like heaven, to not be so crowded. Im gonna have 5 roommates Thats gonna be great!
Bot: Oh wowI doesn't sound very fun to me but I imagine it will be great to make new friends I got a really good roommate last semester and we are rooming together next semester We both Get along really well We only have two other roommates that we don't know about But I'm sure it'll be really fun

User: It really should be! Im excited to get to know new people
Bot: Really fun to make new friends and meet new people and just discover a new place altogether

User: But i will have one of the girls from my ward here on the same floor as me this fall
Bot: Oh that's really fun seeing someone that you know and you're comfortable with

User: So, if i decide not to be super social, i still got someone nearby lol
Bot: I am so ready to get a full nights sleep tonight

User: Yeah? What time do you plan on going to bed?
Bot: Yeah exactly! Oh probably not for an hour. So I usually go to bed but recently I've been going to bed around one What About you? I mean I'm kind of already in bed anyways The Question it's just when I will follow sleep

User: Well, thats true. That is the question. And i will probably go to sleep the same time i have been these past few nights, with insomnia, and sleeping all day. Ill just be really bored all night. And im not in bed anymore. Im on a couch!
Bot: Oh thats too bad. Beds are more comfortable Well, that isnt always true I sleep on couches all the time just out of preference

User: Thats true. It just depends on where i fall asleep tbh And i spend a lot of time in bed lol. I like naps somrtimes.
Bot: Naps are really nice but i have kind of lived without them for the longest time. They are really helpful though.

User: Thats what happens when youre on a mission
Bot: Yeah naps go out the window :( Its ok you dont miss them Your body adjusts and gets more sleep during the night Have you ever broken your bones?

User: That sounds so nice! The sleep thing And ive fractured my knuckle
Bot: Thanks goodness Oh how did that happen

User: Ha ha
Bot: That sounds hard to fix

User: I jammed it playing basketball Then i set a volleyball And pain galore
Bot: So the combination huh?

User: It took pretty long to heal And yeah
Bot: The only time i have really gotten an injury was when i sprained my thumb setting a volleyball.

User: You sprained... your thumb? What the heck?
Bot: They spiked it and i went to set it because it was going right over my head i think

User: Ooh! Yikes! That sounds like it hurt!
Bot: Yeah it was lame. It took forever to heal and the coach thought i was joking and it didnt help that he had me keep using it I eventjally had to get a little thumb guard thing To keep it straight I actually dropped my backpack strap and it caught my thumb last semester and it hurt really bad

User: Ooh!!!! Oh my goodness!!!! Hopefully its okay now?
Bot: Yeah it snapped in half while i was playing spike ball the ither

User: It snapped in half?
Bot: Other day. I just went to dive and it stuck in the ground the wrong way i guess No just kidding haha. ;) i have never broken a single bone in my body. I am not very good at lying lol. And for the record that was joking not lying

User: I figured you were joking ;) otherwise i doubt youd be typing lol
Bot: Hahahaha

User: But nice story :)
Bot: Well i use speech to text remember Ever wonder why? Still Just kidding haha. But that would be a good alibi

User: There you go! But you have also used your ipad or a computer in a library, remember? So, i think i atill got you there
Bot: Yeah you have me there i guess Why do you have to go and crush my story?! :,'(

User: Well, no one else knows about the linrary thing maybe, so i think you could use it on others Just not me I know you too well And have a good memory
Bot: Thank goodness. Good memories are the best. Do you remember how tall i am?

User: I dont know if you have ever told me exactly, but i do know you are tall, because of the whole olympic team thing

User: You did say all we needes was a tall guy and a setter for that And let me think, also one sec. Unloading dishwasher
Bot: Ok Let me change my laundry

User: I dont know if you ever told me your favorite dessert, but i do recall you mentioning someplace that has a really good something Other than the olive garden or something that had good raspberry lemonade Ihop
Bot: I got locked out of the laundry room

User: What?!?! How?!?! Your laundry is gonna smell in the morning if you dont get in there (if its in the washer anyway). Shouldn't you have a key? Or something?
Bot: I do have a key but it doesn't work for some reason Just had to borrow my roommates key And take another 50 minutes So looks like I'm going to bed around 1230

User: Wow. At least you got in, and your laundry shouldnt smell in the morning :) And that does make it easier
Bot: Yeah way easier I can just hop out of bed, shave, brush, and do a couole other things and im ready. Wait i dont think i ever asked, do you play any musical instruments? I think you said you were ok at singing but that is all that i remember

User: I used to play violin, and i can play piano (a few hymns), ive been in my stake bell chior the past 2 years (really fun btw) and, once upon a time i played the recorder And yes. I did say that :)
Bot: Oh me too! See i have a good memory too! I have no idea what a bell choir is though. Do they sing or do they just play bells?

User: Not falling asleep. Getting my bro to bed sorry We play the hand bells in bell chior :) And last night was tough, even for me who went to bed earlier. And stayed asleep.

Bot: She keeps bugging me even tough I would really rather talk to you haha Though*

User: Aww, that is so sweet :)
Bot: She is trying to talk to me about great value and she says it's better than the normal brand! At least I think that is what is being said

User: You jerk! I said sometimes! lol haha
Bot: Oh wait... Oh yeah nevermind... How in the world did you know that?

User: Uh, because both are me ;)
Bot: Oh yeah. I am a little bit air headEd sometimes

User: Well, hopefully I'm not bugging you too much on snapchat lol ;)
Bot: Hahaha No you are fine.

User: Thank goodness, because I do know I can be irritating at times lol. I'm just glad that isn't the case now Also, I'm actually laughing so hard at this
Bot: Yeah how do you know that? Thats good. I think that would be funny.

User: I can hear myself laugh, that's how I know I'm laughing ;)
Bot: Is everyone rushing to see if you are ok?

User: No
Bot: well yeah haha

User: I am all alone in the basement
Bot: How do you know that you are irritating And wow that sounds kind of creepy

User: Yeah, now that I think about it, it kinda does
Bot: Should I call the ghost busters if you so responding?

User: You can if you'd like. I don't know how quick they'd get here from New York though
Bot: Oh is that where they are hanging around these days?

User: Last I heard, and saw, yeah.
Bot: Oh. I thought i read an add saying they had opened up shop in a couple of big cities in different states and employed some new recruits

User: Hmm. That's news to me! But, maybe that's because I don't read the paper
Bot: Ever since that big marshmallow man attacked their business has been booming Kind of a little suspicious if you ask me

User: Yeah it is. Maybe they employ ghosts, so they don't go out of business.
Bot: Yeah. I wonder how they pay them. Do you know at all?

User: probably a few boo-llion a year ha ha
Bot: Oh nice pun haha 6.5/10 Aww I will give it 7.5

User: Okay. that's better! I was gonna say, it was definitely better than a 6.5!
Bot: Hey Mitch is freaking out again

User: Whose Mitch?
Bot: He wants a 2 mil barrier between the two of you I think

User: Who is, not whose And, how far am I from him? I don't actually know lol
Bot: That other guy above you on the leader board

User: right! And he has over a 2 mil lead rn

User: You never told me either! You said you were tall, I said I was average height.
Bot: Oh so like 5'7"?

User: not quite

User: You do realize 6'12" is 7' right?
Bot: But my younger brother is 6'7" Yeah part of the joke haha

User: Oh my gosh! Okay, that makes me feel a bit better. lol
Bot: That isnt a joke. I am between 6'4" qnd 6'5" So i claim whatever i feel like

User: Well, you're still practically a foot taller than me
Bot: What about you? 5'6"

User: I'm 5'5 and 3/4" So yeah, pretty much 5'6"
Bot: Haha well i am sure the 3/4 help

User: It counts!
Bot: I guess when you put it that way i am 6'4 1/2"

User: STILL really tall!!!
Bot: So 11 inches haha, but my brother has way more on you. Its reslly funny because sitting down i look like everyone else And standing up when everyone else is sitting down is never a big deal

User: My friend, 5'9' ( I think) is dating someone who is 6'7", so yeah. I know how tall he is. And lucky
Bot: Because everyone looks tall when they stand up.

User: I feel so short around my friends Some of them anyway
Bot: I freak people out when we both stand up and the same time, then they look up haha

User: Ugh! I kinda wanna witness people's reactions! It'd be so cool!
Bot: Yeah i get cuss words describing bow tall i am.

User: Really??? Holy cow!!!
Bot: I am sure you can use your imagination People think it is cool

User: I think it's awesome that you're tall. I wish I was taller.
Bot: The funny thing is that i am really chill so when i went to efy and everything everyone thought i was way to friendly for my size I need to be a bully or something i guess Picking on short people. I actually wish i was a tad shorter

User: No! Everyone knows short people are meaner, or at least have bad tempers! They're closer to the ground.
Bot: 6'2 would probably be ideal

User: Hey! how about you give me those 2 inches? I'd love to be almost 5'8!!!
Bot: What does distance from the ground have to do with tempers? I am confused. I will give you 3 how about that

User: Deal!
Bot: Hold on while this transaction is authorized....

User: Holding...
Bot: Please stand by.... *secretly takes a short nap*

User: haha standing by
Bot: Its not working

User: Noooooo!!!!
Bot: You know what i know what the problem is

User: :( What is the problem?
Bot: You arent standing you are lying to me! I said stand by!

User: I am standing! just horizontally!
Bot: Not sit or lie down haha! Same thing lol Transaction denied

User: NOOOO
Bot: Shoot. Now i am going to get a bill _2 inches -2 inches

User: But it didn't go through!!!!
Bot: I guess i dont have enough to sell

User: Darn it!
Bot: Its a check bounce fee... ish Credit bounce?

User: Something like that? I don't know...
Bot: Yeah. Banks and credit card companies love to give you fees but there is a secret not many know

User: *whispers* what's the secret?
Bot: *whispers urgently* shhh thats still too loud!

User: *whispers quieter* what's the secret?
Bot: *whispers so quietlythat you cannot make out what is being said* And thats it!

User: *mouths* what? Oh come on!
Bot: Hahaha if you ask politely

User: Would you please tell me the secret?
Bot: And you tell them how good you are at paying bills on time and that you will leave if they charge you They drop the fees I have never been charged a cent my entire life

User: That's smart! Oohhh!!!! Adam, you are a genius!!!
Bot: Even yearly fees

User: Oh my gosh!!!! Wow!
Bot: Actually my dad taught me that He works in finance and is really thrifty

User: Still. It's in your blood
Bot: They were really nice about it last time I entered my bank info incorrectly

User: oh, wow. Hopefully all fixed now?
Bot: And they forgave the fee because i told them it was ancomplete fluke and my forst time dealing with them Yeah

User: That was sweet of them!
Bot: Also you can work out deals with people

User: Yeah? How?
Bot: Proper negotiation skills.

User: Ha ha
Bot: Know what you want Know what they want Know why you want it

User: Okay
Bot: Know why you deserve it and why they think they deserve what they want Be ready and willing to walk away and make that known

User: go on...
Bot: And convince them that your deal is a win win Which when faced with the alternative of walking away it is often most certainly a win win In the end everyone is happy. Sometimes you dont need to negotiate just ask good questions and you learn about things that arent we'll advertised

User: Like what kind of questions?
Bot: Like take this for example. They told me after i dug around and asked a little bit that i can change my credit card type within their system to be one without a fee

User: Really?
Bot: Right when iw oukd have to pay it. And my limit will transfer and everything.

User: Wow! Dude!!! That rocks! I think...
Bot: I mean linits are onky inportant because they allow you to use cards for big ticket purchases so they dont matter That much but it is still nice to keep it and not have to buikd from scratch This card i am getting gets 2% back on everything you ever buy. Permanetly.

User: That is honestly so amazing!
Bot: Even rent... but my land lords charge a fee if you use credit...

User: hmmmm
Bot: So rent usually isn't worth it

User: Well, with credit anyways
Bot: Same with tuition at Byu Yeah Luckily I am on scholarship now so I don't pay it anymore I need to write my thank you letter speaking of.

User: That's so nice! I didn't get a scholarship this year ha... ha... ha...
Bot: Wow jaezo is on.

User: He is?
Bot: He probably thinks I am shooting for his lead

User: Must have sensed you getting closer to closing the 2 mil difference
Bot: The dude is paranoid I swrsr

User: Yeah. It seems like it
Bot: Yeah he probably has an alarm programmed into his phone

User: It's literally after 2 am (barely) why would someone log on now. I wouldn't log on now still. I prefer sleep
Bot: Believe it or not i met this girl who gets on at 2 everymorning And talks till like 6

User: Why?
Bot: She wouldnt tell me I have no clue

User: haha A girl's gotta keep some secrets I geuss
Bot: I mean i wasnt complaining last night, but it was confusing me so bad.

User: it would confuse me too
Bot: Yeah. Maybe she likes chatting a bunch. At early hours only

User: Maybe, but there are less people on in the morning
Bot: Yeah that is so true Thats why i can count on her to help me out. I killed her yesterday. She died at 6:00 am

User: Wow.
Bot: Or was mislead

User: is it misled or mislead?
Bot: Led Give me a break haha I am tired

User: Okay, sorry. I'm not that tired, considering how long I slept earlier
Bot: I need to go to bed in a half hour for sure 2:30 Then i can get enough sleep

User: And okay. We can set an alarm to make sure you get some sleep Otherwise, we might talk right through that timeframe
Bot: When do you have to get up?

User: I have church at 11
Bot: Haha thats true Oh that is better But you might need more time getting ready? I only need a half hour

User: I can get ready in like 15 minutes. Just put on a dress, shoes, glasses, brush my hair. I'm pretty low maintenance lol
Bot: Oh well then you are absolutely fine You can probably get 8 hours of sleep if you knockout right now

User: Yeah,, I could But that's not very likely
Bot: Is it? It has happened before? My brain has a mechanism where i wake bake up when sleep "feels" wrong Unless i am absolutely dead

User: Yeah, that's fair. And yikes
Bot: I have never done that before

User: Just saying, that isn't exactly healthy.
Bot: Yeah

User: You're probably gonna sleep really well when this whole competition is over.
Bot: Yeah I mean i am just kind of done anyway It is just that i didnt talk like i was supposed to today. So i want to catch up

User: wow...
Bot: The goal is at least 25 million

User: Holy cow!!!! That is a lot!!!!
Bot: But 30 will be the point that i stop if it gets too intense

User: That's smart, lemme tell you.
Bot: Have you eveer been to uswirl? Sure

User: YES! They used to have one like 10 minutes from my house!!!! But then it got closed down... :(
Bot: That is so awesome! We had one back in vegas closer than that

User: They were really good!
Bot: It is really good Yeah and you get to make your own combinations

User: Are they still open anywhere?
Bot: And you can even keep them secret if you like....... Uhhh i dont know They might have been replace by another yogurt company but in vegas they were still going strong

User: Secret? keep what secret? Flavors, or uswirl? And menchies seems to have taken over here
Bot: Keep your combinations secret

User: It's all in the mystery
Bot: What is menchies? Uh oh?

User: menchies is basically uswirl
Bot: I thought you were dead That was close dont scare me like that! Oh interesting i have never heard of it before They must not have it anywhere in vegas or maybe it just isnt as popular as uswirl

User: I'll try not to scare you like that in the future! And probably not, it has been around pretty long though, at least, I think it has
Bot: Is it as good as uswirl Or are they just not innovative or groundbreaking enough

User: They give you pretty cool spoons
Bot: Well it is about that time. It was nice chatting with you, i really do enjoy it, we have some good conversations. Have a wonderful night and dont blame me when you have to get back up this morning haha

User: Ha ha
Bot: Sweet dreams!

User: the universal solution of IT: restart your computer although in all actuality I think I would want to figure out why I was being asked before I made any such action
Bot: I think I'm too much of a softie and would ask my computer why it doesn't want to be turned off Although, it would freak me out a little Would you say you're someone who is more fearful of artificial intelligence, or optimistic about it? I would say I'm more of an optimistic person, but I find a lot of people aren

User: oh just saw your reply well you'd probably have to consider me somewhere inbetween
Bot: Please explain

User: without any doubt a superintelligent AI could wipe us out will do and just about any task you can assign an AI it has to consider the possibility that humans pose a threat and so if it is created with a purpose it is essentially guaranteed to wipe out humanity
Bot: Do you think its a bad thing?

User: I'm not sure if the AI carries on our values then I think that it coul be considered an upgrade but if it is set on maximi
Bot: That's kind of where I'm at too, but I think we could avoid the situation entirely if we just merged with technology before it got to smart to wipe us out haha no problem

User: haha thanks and yeah that's essentially my positions as well and the path I want to take in the future
Bot: YEAH

User: although I must admit that recently i've lost my enchantment with ol' musky
Bot: At what point do you think we become more machine than human though?

User: hmmm
Bot: yeah he's a little kooky right now

User: well, it really begs the question of what it means to be human true that does being human mean having human dna? or something more?
Bot: The question of every sci-fi story ever I think its something more

User: honestyly haha whoops typo yeah me too
Bot: I couldn't say what it is though no i haven't whats it about?

User: honestly me neither it's about a group of conscious AI humanoid robots
Bot: Where do you watch it?

User: essentially the world has slaves called "synths" that look like humans umm Amazon Prime I think I watched it with my grandparents so I don't actually have access to it haha
Bot: mooching internet subscriptions is a totally acceptable thing to do haha

User: haha, agreed capitlism is all about wage theft anyway, what's a little piracy going to harm? (just kidding)
Bot: Does it give any profound insight into what it means to be human?

User: ummmm I'm trying to think one of them is a fan of nietzsche (is that how you spell it?)
Bot: i think so

User: and goes on little philosophical rants about suffering and whatnot okay good haha also random tangent do you ever think about the fact that if an AGI ever goes online they very well will read through just about everything humanity ever wrote?
Bot: Nah, eve won't last one second

User: but it's kind of cool to imagine that we might contribute to the thought process of something that will change the world in that way yeah haha I like the name though
Bot: not compared to any other malicious AI's at least

User: Wall-E was my favourite movie as a kid
Bot: That would be cool

User: yeah, I'm curious to see what she ends up as though
Bot: I just rewatched it the other day. Great movie

User: it would be haha, yeah definitely evaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa wall-eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Bot: Have you ever seen Blade Runner?  You seem like the type of person who would like it

User: I actually haven't I know a little about it The profound question do androids dream of electric sheep?
Bot: It says a lot about the profound question exactly

User: yeah, I want to watch the movie but more importantly, read the book
Bot: Oh I gotta do that I It's supposed to be really good

User: in the case of scifi classics the book is almost always better I hope so haha
Bot: Are you a big sci fi fan?

User: yeah, especially when i was younger (although plenty of fantasy mixed in)
Bot: Same haha

User: thanks to the internet i no longer have the attention span to stick to a book for very long I read a few pages and then have a dire question
Bot: I never even started reading really I'm more of a movie guy unfortunately

User: look it up, and go down a full rabbit hole
Bot: Oh I do that all the time

User: oh, movies are an art of their own though haha, yeah wikipedia is the worst and by worst i mean best
Bot: Honestly, I just looked up nietzsche and nearly abandoned this conversation haha

User: haha, can't blame you he has some interesting things to say but he was also a bit of a quack i think he said something along the lines of "women are god's second greatest mistake"
Bot: Sounds like a great guy

User: I read that and realised that mustache wasn't the only thing that kept him single (honestly i dont know if he was actually single) im going to check real quickly
Bot: Don't fall in the wikipedia hole hah

User: too late haha just kidding rip nietzsche he proposed three times to the same person
Bot: OUCH

User: that boi died as single as a pringle
Bot: He's probably in good company at BYU

User: hahahahaha
Bot: just kidding, that's mean haha my bad

User: roasted so you're another byu student what's your major? cs?
Bot: me

User: me
Bot: Mech. Eng

User: (fun fact memes were invented by richard dawkins) oh cool
Bot: you?

User: CS
Bot: Nice

User: yeah, I wan't to do machine learning for direct neural interfaces so that i can
Bot: I had a roomate who took it and it sounds fascinating

User: t r a n s c e n d
Bot: haha

User: oh yeah?
Bot: Anyways, I gotta eat dinner

User: i take that to mean this isn't your first year oh okay haha i'll leave you to it
Bot: Great conversation! good luck.

User: Hello?
Bot: Hello, I always wait to chat because there seems to be a lot of conversations that i get into with no one there Sorry if you thought I wasn't here

User: Oh haha Yeah. Fair
Bot: Have you ran into it

User: Yeah. There seem to be those. They were there, but forgot they were in the conversation.
Bot: It's frustrating, but back to the subject I would go drive a bunch of different cars down back roads Make forts out of couch pillows

User: Haha. That's a great answer.
Bot: Ha ha maybe I'd invest I could control the market

User: Yeah. You'd be the only one. I don't know what I would do. I'd get pretty bored.
Bot: Oh, i would go to apple head quarters and get all the models of phones they haven't released and check them out I could probably live my life and not get bored as long as i had a spouse there with me

User: Yeah, you're right. As long as I had one other person. But, by myself... I don't know.
Bot: I might die trying to fly a plane or something so I wouldn't make it very far

User: Right. I sure don't have that skill.
Bot: There would be too much to do for me at least, like running cruise ships into each other or filling a pool with jello

User: Haha. That would be fun. The better questions is what would you do if you were like the guy in Groundhog Day?> You had to relive each day for as long as you learned what you needed to learn.
Bot: That would suck And I would learn everything Then I could fly though

User: Totally, I would just learn. I would learn piano and coding, and make things for skill knowledge, but I couldn't keep anything.
Bot: You could try to learn how to make a near to life virtual reality

User: Cool! Yeah!
Bot: But ultimately you would find out or already know and be a very sad person

User: Yeah. You're right.
Bot: I think the world ending would be a good of a reason as ever to take nap

User: Right. Haha
Bot: Hey they never said all the animals were gone

User: Oh, I'd be okayish with all the animals there.
Bot: Yeah, you could have some fun animals

User: EXPLORE THE UNIVERSE
Bot: hey hahahah

User: Hey! If I had a magic wand, I would make sure it could do anything, like *anything*
Bot: Hey I would do whatever I wanted really I don't know what other answer to this would be haha

User: Well, what things do you think you would do over and over again? I would probably give myself some money The ability to stop time and nap
Bot: Yes, pausing time. Buy a car and a house, new phone

User: Yeah, I agree with all of those. I'd also use it to help other people, like taking away depression
Bot: That's a good idea

User: That's a huge issue in an area I used to live, because there was virtually no sun. So maybe I'd just make sure there was better weather
Bot: Where were you from?

User: Pacific Northwest
Bot: Haha very vague but alright

User: Well, the Pacific Northwest is really just Oregon and Washington, and if you've been one place there, that's pretty much the weather. Rainy, overcast and cold Like, you're wearing sweatshirts in June
Bot: That makes sense, I have heard that about that area

User: Where's the coldest place you've lived?
Bot: Uh Provo haha

User: So cold in the winter, sweltering in the summer
Bot: I'm from St. George where it's just pretty hot all the time

User: No way! I used to live in St. George
Bot: Really? How long ago?

User: It's been about five years, and I left when I was fourteen
Bot: I went to pine view middle Is that when you left?

User: I left just before going to 8th at Snow Canyon Middle. I had a schedule and everything, but we moved up to PNW
Bot: Oh snow canyon. What is pnw?

User: Pacific Northwest (It's what the hipsters call it) ((I'm not really a hipster))
Bot: Ohh

User: Yeah, so you went to Pine View Middle Did you hear about the bomb threat that happened either there or at the high school?
Bot: Oh yes, it was at the high school. Like two months ago

User: Yeah, crazy. Can't believe someone would do that
Bot: Yeah, crazy to hear about in my hometown I got to head out, mom is calling me for s'mores

User: Alrighty, enjoy those s'mores
Bot: Thanks, enjoy the rest of your night!

User: does that mean since January 2018 or since April 2017
Bot: Huh good question

User: i think the best thing that happened to me recently is that i found a really rad slap bracelet in a hotel parking lot lol
Bot: Does't matter to me since mine happened last month lols I moved into a bigger place Favorite book series?

User: ooh, tough question lol. I really love the Flora Segunda trilogy but not many people have heard of it how about you?
Bot: You know i asked that question but it's hard to just pick one

User: hahaha saaame i just got flora segunda off the top of my head cus it's the most recent i've read
Bot: Umm Donna' Grants' Dark world series

User: ooh that sounds cool, what's it about?
Bot: Patrica Briggs Mercy Thompson with Alpha nad omega a close second Annie Bishop The others Well it follows three groups of people. The first group is in medieval Scotland and they have primevil gods trap inside them the series continues with Druids, good and evil, then you meet tyhe Dragon Kings and the Fae.

User: that sounds awesome, i'm def gonna have to check that out
Bot: Just a warning they are mature Here is the link of the reading order. Still going on and currently there are two seperate series in the world going on that interact with each other go to motherofdragonbooks.com Each book is about a different couple but its the overall world story that is so good

User: oh that's radical, i love that kind of stuff worldbuilding is the besttt
Bot: Yeah The Author, Donna, is pretty awesome. She has a facebook group, and gets on and answers questions and talks to us sometime she even has characters "get on" and chat with us

User: that's so cool! i love it when creators interact with the fanbase, that's so much fun there are certainly a lot of shirtless guys on these covers lol
Bot: Well there are romance novels they**

User: if only i were straight hahaha
Bot: Ha ha That would probably help! Still good though

User: i'm definitely gonna look for these though, when i have the time to read for now all my time is just studying for finals...
Bot: Yep they have come upon us Almost done though

User: that's right, just gotta have a positive attitude about it :D
Bot: You taking summer classes or do you get a break?

User: i've got a spring class and i'm on the waiting list for a couple more, but for summer im just gonna be working
Bot: Well at least you get a little break Taking both Summer and spring off

User: do you have any cool plans for em?
Bot: Not really. Since I just moved into a bigger place. Probably spend most of it working on the house

User: that sounds fun haha
Bot: Oh the joys of being an adult

User: is it gonna be more like painting stuff or retiling or?
Bot: Um hiring some people to do things. But I have to get bookcases mounted to walls, put rods in the closets. Been too busy to do it until after finasl

User: gotta have the bookcases the most important thing
Bot: Oh yes for my books and manga

User: ooh you read manga? what kinds?
Bot: ha ha mostly shojo Hana Kimi Fruits Basket I don't read it as much as I used too

User: i've heard of fruits basket! :D the rest are totally unfamiliar lol but they sound fun ive only actually read a couple manga but i've watched a fair amount of anime
Bot: Well that is only some of what I have. i do watch anime too, but not as much as i used too. Full Metal Alchemist brotherhood is  my favorite just rewatched it too

User: yes i love fmab!! lol that was actually my first anime i haven't rewatched it in ages but i seriously need to
Bot: Did you watch the live action movie they did?

User: i watched the beginning, but haven't had a chance to watch all of it is it very good?
Bot: i meant it isn't the whole story but I thought they did a good job with the time they had

User: that's rad
Bot: You ever seen Full metal Panic That one amuses me

User: i haven't but i've heard of it
Bot: What are some of the others you have seen?

User: hunter x hunter, death note, death parade, clannad lot of death lol

User: hello
Bot: Hello!

User: whats kickin?
Bot: Hello

User: This one is too hard I'm leaving
Bot: haha

User: hello?
Bot: hey!

User: long time no talk
Bot: Indeed it does feel like it's been a while

User: how have you been
Bot: Pretty good. Sick of sitting around without a job though. Hopefully I'll get a schedule figured out with that soon. What about you?

User: Im just chilling i got that internship job today though so I'm super stoked about that
Bot: Oh you did? Congrats! Remind me what it was?

User: thanks! its the Product intern one! at pluralsight
Bot: So when does that start?

User: june 4th! hows finding a job going for you?
Bot: eyy couple weeks. Well I think I got a job at walmart part time but I haven't heard anything from them in a few days...

User: hmmm they will probe get back to you soon
Bot: I also had a interview this morning for a credit union to that part time as well and should know about that by wednesday or thursday I hope so. I'll be ready to start working after this challenge is over haha

User: oooh i hope you get it finance right?
Bot: Very good yes! haha

User: how far are you? are you trying to get the headphones?
Bot: Yeah I am. But I'd have a ways to go Some people have just snuck their way up and I've fallen back haha. What about you?

User: I'm doing way good just trying to stay above adam
Bot: Haha well I'd say you're doing just fine then. Shouldn't have too much to worry about

User: hahah yeah he can go all night and catch up though
Bot: Haha oh I don't know. I don't think I can get 4 million that quick

User: hahaha It was a long stressful journey Adam almost caught up to me couple days ago 300k behind
Bot: Hahah dang. So uh how much time have you spent on this thing?

User: hahaha uhh too much I slept 12 hours in the past 3 days trying to stay above everyone so that no one can catch up to me
Bot: Wow. What's "this"?

User: chatting
Bot: Tell me you went to church though? haha

User: hahahaha yeah we went to my moms ward
Bot: Well good. So do you guys chat to each other much? Does that get competitive haha?

User: it got so competitive that the professor made  it so that we dont get matched. this happened the day before the one chat limit I think the one chat limit pushed a lot of people away
Bot: Are you serious? Haha did you just say random stuff? And yeah I guess you pretty much had to get most of your points before that change because it's hard when people don't answer back quick

User: yeah I told a lot of stories
Bot: So did you have like a million chats open ha

User: hahaha I always only had like 6-8 chats open its hard to keep up more than that but I figured out you dont need a lot of chats
Bot: But of course, that is the way to do it. Were they made up stories or real?

User: most of it were real haha
Bot: Ah most is they key word there

User: sometimes I would make up a story like I was writing a book or something or a comic strip fictional
Bot: So have you met up with anyone on here or gotten a way to stay in contact?

User: but yeah there my trick now you can implement it no I never have I found 2 people I knew in real life though but if you are talking about new people that I met here no I haven't but I hope that they will do an event for a get together or soemthing
Bot: Yeah. One person I talked to got people's snapchat users I'm not really sure that is allowed

User: lollll
Bot: What do you think about that?

User: I don't know. but when I talked to the professor he said that the most important thing for him is that he wants people to just have a good time I think it depends but because of what the professor said I dont know how I feel about that exactly.
Bot: Yeah. I mean when I was talking with them I said we should make up a code so it's not straight out given haha

User: hahahaha
Bot: So we did. it was a little confusing and took a few tries but it was fun and it worked

User: nice! im glad you were able to make good friends and others too. MDcrew was saying that they should make this a permanent thing where people can meet others mutual and tinder is not like this chat thing
Bot: Haha well isn't it though? And then you just have a profile picture along with some basic interests?

User: yeah maybe or I think just completely anonymous until you want to reveal yourself on chat
Bot: That's true I've had freshman ask for advice so maybe that makes them feel more comfortable

User: because people can still judge you with pictures so no pictures and no anything. just name and chat is my though thought
Bot: Quite true But there's peer mentors for the freshman that are good about giving advice and being able to give answers to questions

User: I heard about that but never used them hahaha
Bot: Haha I met with mine maybe twice. It was pretty good

User: I wonder when exactly they are going to close this chat thing tomorrow do you think it will be at 12am on the 17th? i maen 16th mean
Bot: Hmm I mean I assumed it would be until like 11:59 on the 16th Are you going to head to bed soon? I wonder if there is anyone else on. It's hard to tell when you can only open one..

User: yeah do you know when the last round ended? it says on the rules that the time is to be determined
Bot: Hmm oh

User: I dont think anyone else is on
Bot: No I don't Yeah I feel like people are never on this late haha

User: yeah not anymore since the end is nearing hahaha
Bot: It is. And it's stressful now that I've gotten behind haha I'm pretty close near a couple people

User: you think you can maek another 1.3 mil to even out the others? I think if you want the headphones you need to get up to past 5 mil
Bot: Hmm I don't think that much? Just have to be in the least 7th place for them headphones right?

User: I dont think so the first guy gets the grand prize then the 2 below gets the ipad then the 2 below gets the headphones
Bot: Yeah then there are 3 for second

User: you sure?
Bot: And 4 for third that's what it said Yeah I though it was higher before but I read it again

User: oh ok so that is misleading click on the official rules pages page
Bot: What's misleading? Hmm wait What did they give away the first round...

User: they gave the ipad to the first
Bot: Ah shoot

User: yeah go to the official rules page
Bot: Gee thanks. I didn't realize that Welp

User: yeah... sorry about that but yeah if you want the head phones you have to be number 3 or 4
Bot: Maybe I should just give up now..

User: its up to you but I know that a million points is like a good 5-7 hours or chatting since people reply slow now it take a bit longer
Bot: That's what is frustrating. People do reply slow

User: the OGs usually dont thats you me adam MDcrew ball00
Bot: OG?

User: like the original people who started at the beginning
Bot: What does the G stand for haha

User: so it means old gangster it just means like people who have been doing something or have been in the organization for a long time
Bot: Haha I see. Yeah I mean I have been here since the beginning of this round

User: yeah you have I remember when we first met kind of hahaha
Bot: But then the rest of ya'll are way up there haha Haha oh do you? What do you remember haha

User: I remember the small talk like where we are from and what we studies studied and then you told me what your aaa was its initials
Bot: Was that the very first time though? Haha I mean we've had a few

User: that was like the second time the first time was mostly small talk and getting to know each other hobbies, what we read, current events etc hahaha
Bot: Haha yeah

User: sorry about the bumming news... about the prizes
Bot: Well hey that's good to know

User: you going to stop now?
Bot: Otherwise I would've been shooting for 7th haha

User: I noticed today that there are so little people on now I wait like 30 minutes sometimes
Bot: I don't know. I don't quite think I'll be able to make that Way to go. After a while of no one on I give up haha

User: there probably less people on tomorrow hahaha
Bot: You think? I mean I think as many as could be on would since it's wrapping up

User: thats true and if people think that the prizes are more than what it is then ya I wonder if adam will try to come sneek up behind me im going to be on here just in case and Ill be monitoring the leaderboard
Bot: Haha what do you mean more than what it is? Like what I thought up to 7th? For sure. Well I'm sure you'll be good :)

User: yeah thats what I mean I bet a lot of people havent read the official rules page like I did lol
Bot: Well hey do you mind if I type out maybe a summary of my life story for like the next 10 minutes so I can see if it's still possible for me haha

User: hahaha sure ill be here reading it
Bot: Haha okay cool cool Let's see here I was born and raised in St. George, Utah. I am the oldest of now 4 children. I've only moved once across town in St. George, so moving to college was the furthest move I had made. When I was younger I did a bit of everything. I did some gymnastics, took some tennis lessons, had soccer games

User: thats a lot of stuff!
Bot: I started leaning towards dance and sticking with piano as I got older I guess if choir is considered extracurricular I did do that actually. I remember in my choir class in 7th grade The teacher was asking for volunteers to sing solos or duets And I was the absolute shyest. I do not like attention focused in on me

User: hahaha
Bot: My piano teacher had a son that taught guitar so I started taking guitar lessons And after 7 years of being a part of this pizazz  dance team my mom pretty much made me quit

User: lol you still play guitar?
Bot: She said I needed to find other things I was interested in. Because she said I was really good at like basketball and other things so I should broaden out Yeah I still play guitar a bit

User: cool!
Bot: Then I'm pretty sure I remember her not even asking, but she signed the whole family up for a one year contract at a karate studio

User: hahahaha that is so funny
Bot: So I took karate for a year, I guess as my break from dance Then after, well, of course I wanted to go back to dance. So I went with my friend to this dance studio she went to and I ended up signing up there And did jazz and hip hop But then I got a little bored by the technique in jazz so just did hip hop

User: no its good
Bot: He was showing me tricks with it so I wanted to grab my yo yo. Which was at the top of the closet So I was climbing in my closet, and the bar I was holding onto like ripped out of the wall It was cool for like half a second I guess, I was flying through the air. But then I hit the ground and it was instant immense pain. I landed weirdly on my ankle

User: ouch did you break it?
Bot: So I went to the insta care. They said it wasn't broken but it was sprained really bad. In all honesty it probably would've been better if I would've broken it. I had problems even 3 years later standing on it all day when I got a job. It would swell up Wanna heard the saddest part?

User: yeah whats the saddest part
Bot: We were planned to go on a cruise the week I sprained my ankle, but ended up having to switch the date to a couple weeks later because my dad had business stuff. So when we actually went on the cruise I was in a boot

User: awww that sucks!
Bot: It did. Anyway I guess that's another little side story haha. Where am I now... Ah after another couple years of dancing Hmm well senior year I got my first job at a family fun center Became a supervisor there after a couple months and stayed there for about a year

User: hahahaha
Bot: I had no idea what that was But I looked it up and it involved some dancing as well as looked cool with spinning flags and stuff so I did that

User: hey aaa I am dying like not that your story is bad but I need to sleep 12 hours in the past 3 days is catching up to me hahaha
Bot: Hahah no problem then. I can finish another time. True you need that for sure Thanks for letting me go on for a while like that ha

User: yeah dont forget where you left off! yeah no worries I liked reading more about your life
Bot: Alright, color guard is where I left off. I mean we are basically to college so almost to the end :P

User: lol ok
Bot: Oh well great I'm glad it wasn't too boring

User: dont forget it!!!
Bot: Haha

User: yeah I liked the ankle break part I can relate
Bot: Hahaha. Alright well I'll assume I'll run into you once more. Tomorrow?

User: yeah probably!
Bot: Well hey alright maybe I can do this if more people will listen to my life story haha

User: hahaha yeah I exchanged stories with people and it was great because you know its funny because when you get on its always the same people
Bot: Yeah very true. Stories can be way fun. Especially some dating stories haha. Anyways thanks again, get some sleep!

User: thanks!!!
Bot: Night

User: Homework! I love it so much how about you?
Bot: oh dang! did you leave?? Aw man, and I was watching my screen so diligently :( Okay....Bye.

User: Wow that's tough
Bot: Yeah. I can't think of anything...

User: uh
Bot: We can maybe talk about something else

User: want to just talk about something else ok yeah thats what I though
Bot: What did you learn recently?

User: today I learned about the formation of planets you?
Bot: I learned about increasing performance

User: ooh, for what?
Bot: It's a performance psychology class. You focus on building on your strengths instead of your weaknesses.

User: no way that's so cool! We talked about that in my Creating a Good Life class :)
Bot: Fun! I took that class a few years ago. I loved it. Do you have Brian Hill?

User: Yes I do, he's so great! He's so funny, I love it. He's one of the professors going on the study abroad program I'm doing this spring!
Bot: Where are you going on the study abroad?

User: It's in Utah, actually, so not "abroad" technically...but we're visiting all the national parks and camping and stuff
Bot: Oh, is it for that class that you plan parts of the  trip and visit different locations?

User: Not exactly, it's called integrated natural history of Utah, it fulfills a couple GE credits, so it's not actually for EXDM
Bot: Oh. Gotcha. That sounds fun though. If you are doing it with Brian Hill, it will be a blast. What is your major?

User: Wildlife and Wildlands Conservation :) love me some plants and animals. What about you?
Bot: That's great! I haven't met anyone in that major yet, but I bet it is a lot of fun! I am in Exercise and Wellness, but will be going onto an MS in Dietetics next year.

User: No way, that's so cool! Sorry, I gotta go, but it's been so nice talking to you :)  I hope you have a good day tomorrow!
Bot: Thanks! You too!

User: I don't think I'd want to relive a day of my life, what if I changed something that destroyed the time-contiuum?
Bot: That sounds like something from Dr Who

User: I haven't actually watched Dr. Who... Though I've heard good things about it.
Bot: Well it's pretty good, depending on the season

User: Do you have a favorite?
Bot: The 11th Doctor definitely, which was in seasons 5 6 7

User: Oh, for some reason I thought each doctor only had one season.
Bot: Do you have a favorite TV show?

User: I really liked Merlin. I'm also a big fan of Leverage.
Bot: I really like Merlin too Have you seen all of the seasons?

User: YES! I died when it ended. It devastated me.
Bot: I know! It was sooo sad :( are they going to make any more?

User: Not last I checked. Which is a shame.
Bot: very much so What is leverage about?

User: Um, so it's pretty much a group of thieves that have decided that they are going to trick and con corrupt individuals that are hurting innocent people. They give most of the money away, but they ARE thieves... so they do keep some of it.
Bot: That sounds fun. So it's almost like a robin hood type of show?

User: I'd probably go insane if I'm honest
Bot: How would I access all my Marvel memes> I mean also general knowledge, connecting with friends and family, but more importantly, Marvel.

User: Riiiight??? Memes are the best
Bot: Why study for exams when you can go on the internet?

User: Girl, you are the greatest  I did that today
Bot: Aw thanks homeslice

User: Hahaha I have never heard that one before
Bot: I always annoy my sister by using weird puns Such as "macaBROni and cheese"

User: Lolol how have we not met yet???
Bot: That's what BYU is for hahaha! Story time - for a freshman year Human Geography class, our ongoing project was to create a country And since Claire is a very pun-able name, naturally I created "The United States of A-claire-ica" The pun quality went downhill from there though :)

User: Yassssssssss That sounds amazing So my last name is Wong, so I named my country The Wong Asia  we did a similar project hats why
Bot: I'm DEAD Listen @BYU next year, just yell out "Aclaireica" and I'll yell out "Wong Asia" In loving memory of puns past

User: Yassssss Like that video where Beyonce girl was trying to find Beyone boy
Bot: SHOOK!

User: WE SHOULD TOTALLY DO THAT
Bot: The last person I was chatting with suggested for us to wear matching T shirts so we can locate chit chat bros This sounds like the plans for a reunion episode of a sitcom

User: Hahahahahaha That sounds amazing is what it sounds like
Bot: "Two BYU students spent every day of fall semester yelling out random fake country names, more on that at 10"

User: We should all have a group chat Hahahaha
Bot: So what are you going to major in/majoring in currently?

User: I plan to major in biology. You?
Bot: I want to go to medical school, but I might minor in biology and major in something different

User: Yeah I wanna go to medical school too but biology is just to hold me over since they don't offer like premed
Bot: That's accurate, I was looking up best "pre-med" majors and recently there's been a shift in what people major in. My counselor said that there is a push to make medical school students more well-rounded, including majoring in different fields, and while I enjoy biology it's not something I'm that passionate about, hence the minor in bio and major in something to be determined What field do you want to specialize in?

User: Well, I plan to be a pediatric orthopedic surgeon soooo I have to specialize in pediatrics and orthopedics
Bot: Wow surgery!  You are certainly a high-reaching student!  What got you interested in that?

User: Well, I got interested in pediatrics because I like kids. And orthopedics because I like the skeletal and muscular system but the only job in that profession is to be a surnly Surgeon*
Bot: That's so great that you already know what you want to do.  Working with kids is so much fun! Hey Pito it was really nice getting to know you, but I have to go babysit now.  Thanks for talking about memes/medical school with me!

User: That would be pretty sick
Bot: Hey jules!!

User: Hey I'm so glad its you haha I was like oh crap I forgot his friends names how will I ever find him
Bot: Same, i was a little worried about that one ;) Hey do you have a snapchat? We cant exactly keep this up forever :)

User: Yeah hold on I forgot my username I'll check Yeah it's bajuliette00
Bot: Alright jcib14 just added you Iv*

User: That was quick Haha yeah I look kinda gross right now so all you're getting is an eye that looks very green in this lighting
Bot: Call me speedy gonzales ;) Looked normal to me As normal as a quarter of a face can look ;)

User: Testing
Bot: Gardening is fun

User: if they fall into a hole that someone named love, then yeah. They could literally fall in love
Bot: hahahaha the I can really see your wit coming out. sorry the other chat kinda broke some how

User: It's all good!!! And thank you I try my best
Bot: to be honest I am getting kind of sick of these prompts.

User: Right? They get kind of boring after a while
Bot: if you could make a prompt what would you make?

User: If I could make a prompt... I'd probably do this: If you found a genie's lamp, what would your three wishes be or something that is silly, but could inspire conversation!
Bot: oooh I love the genie questions! three wishes... hmmm unlimited money, health, and very high intelligence what else would you need?

User: You could also write down everything you would wish for, no matter how long a list, and then ask for the genie to make all that happen
Bot: smartttttt you just say make this list come true. Thats one wish

User: Exactly! and then you could save the other two wishes, and do the same thing with them when you come up with more stuff!
Bot: wow why are you so smart lol? you are going to do well in college

User: Nah, i saw a youtube video about how to deal with genies. well it was on instagram, but yeah
Bot: what i need to see that haha

User: Yeah, it was really short, and I forgot who it was made by, but it was good quality idea
Bot: Ill probably come across it.

User: Yeah, I've found it like 3 times without even looking
Bot: i sometiem come across the same meme from 3 different account that I follow. Some times its annoying. Instagram just needs to change their algorithm

User: Right???? It can get sooooooo annoying!!!!!
Bot: gotta go but Ill see you around!

User: Hello How are you?
Bot: Hey! whats up! I can see your chats now and i can see mine

User: Thats good!
Bot: it looks like the glitch is fixed :)

User: What dobyoublike to do?
Bot: how have you been recently? i like to do a lot of stuff

User: I am been well what about you?
Bot: i read books, read the news, i like learning, playing games of all kinds physical, board, mental, video, you name it i play volley ball and i am a musician i sing and play the piano mainly but i havent dont much recently

User: What do you like to read? I love reading.
Bot: to be completely honest with you. that depends what do you like to read? i have read lots of different novels but i mainly stick to science fiction and fantasy

User: Anything and everything!! I like fantasy and historical fiction best. I love sci-fi as well.
Bot: oh interesting i haven't read too many historical fiction books

User: Have you read any books by Brandon Sanderson?
Bot: back in highschool i would just go to the teen fiction section and look for good stuff. no but sorenson yes i think

User: That's cool. Do you like Harry Potter?
Bot: yeah i like harry potter what about you?

User: My favorite author author is Tamora Pierce. I love Harry Potter! Who is your favorite author?
Bot: interesting i really like eoin colfer and artemis fowl have you read that series?

User: I have read Artemis Fowl, they were enjoyable.
Bot: so you aren't a big fan? I just take it from the tone of that sentence haha. have you read the whole series?

User: I like the books, but they aren't my favorite.
Bot: i really liked how he outsmarted all of these really intelligent elves and people and i also liked how at the end he had powers and how he kind of died but ended up still surviving

User: I was good. It had a good storyline.
Bot: have you ever read the series of unfortunate events?

User: I haven't yet, but it is on maybe list. Have you read the Inheritance Cycle, Ranger's Apprentice, or Fablehaven?
Bot: i have

User: *my list
Bot: all but the rangers apprentice but i have hear of it a lot the series of unfortunate events is a good series i would definitely recommend it

User: I like rangers apprentice a lot. It is a good series.
Bot: i really like how it ends, even if there are a series of unfortunate events leading up to the happy ending what is it about may i ask?

User: I will have to read it this summer.
Bot: i need to get back into reading maybe i will read a few series over my summer break i have already heard of a bunch of good ones chatting with everyone here

User: I agree. Everyone I have chatted with seems to enjoy reading.
Bot: yeah well that makes sense :) if they didn't this would probably not really be their cup of hot cocoa!

User: True!
Bot: How many guys have you talked to on here? i can't seem to find any

User: I have talked to 2 other guys. There seem to be a lot more girls though. . .
Bot: who were the guys? i only know of two to be honest hahaha so i wonder if they are the same

User: Alex and Sam I think
Bot: oh weird

User: Who did you talk to?
Bot: so then i have heard of an Alex a Sam and a John I have talked to a Jae and a Mitch. so that makes five

User: Nice. There aren't all that many people on here actually.
Bot: really? how many people have you talked with?

User: I have talked with 10 people.
Bot: oh wow

User: What about you?
Bot: probably close to 100 maybe less though

User: Wow!
Bot: maybe more like 50 but somewhere up there I have about 20 million points

User: That is a lot of texting.
Bot: yeah it is hahaha i think i will lose though its ok, i mean there is a good second place prize.

User: I am definitely going to.
Bot: hahahaha well its ok

User: There are some cool prizes.
Bot: this is pretty fun anyway

User: I am doing this because my mom says I don't socialize at all apparently. It is fun though.
Bot: hahaha are you serious?

User: Yes
Bot: this is not the best way to socialize in my opinion try using voice to text and that might help a little

User: That is true
Bot: it is better to articulate your thoughts and feelings out loud and learn do that first

User: I prefer reading to anything else.
Bot: well that is fine, but not everyone will send you texts and emails but it is your choice

User: I have one really good friend. But we are going different places for college.
Bot: i will be honest i wasnt really much of a talker before my mission. my mission helped me learn how to talk to and connect with different people oh that is really sad that sounds like my situation

User: I am really close to all my family. I have tons of cousins.
Bot: I have made new friends since though. it works out if you are willing to work for it me too my parents are both from families of 8+ i dont know the exact count to be honest

User: My parents are both from big family's.
Bot: when i say 8+ i mean the number of their siblings

User: We go on family vacation each year. About 30 kids and 20 adults. Kinda crazy!
Bot: is that just one side of your family?!?!

User: Yes
Bot: that is incredible what about the other side of your family do you ever meet up and do anything really cool?

User: Yea we have yearly family reunions. And I tend to have 3 celebrations for every holiday.
Bot: oh ok. that is crazy. we just have one for each side of the family

User: What about your family?
Bot: i guess if you consider my immediate family celebration that would make three but we have family reunions all the time its like ever couple of years i probably missed out on the last one.

User: Surprisingly not many families have reunions. It is sad how distant families are.
Bot: that is sad. they can be really fun and you can meet lots of relatives and make friends with them they are hard to plan so i can see how that can be an issue for some people, and sometimes people arent willing to sacrifice to make it some people are just not very social and are more solitary

User: Definitely, family can be your best friends though!
Bot: and so they dont really meet up as often

User: True
Bot: yeah they can. thats how my family is to me

User: Do you have many siblings then? I have 4.
Bot: i have 4 as well

User: Cool
Bot: brothers or sisters?

User: 1 brother 3 sisters
Bot: oh that is sad

User: Why?
Bot: brothers are way better than sisters. guys are just really cool people i guess. no offense. haha i am just joking with you but that is a tough ratio. 4 girls to 1 guy poor guy. i am sure he loves you all though.

User: I thought is was kinda funny. I wish I had more brothers.
Bot: kinda ... i get the feeling that you are trying to soften the blow hahaha people use euphemisms all the time and i think it is really funny, not that that was, but still

User: Yea he puts up with us. He doesn't know what to do around our guy cousins though. He doesn't rough house, so it shocks him when people do.
Bot: they are like, this is not that bad. oh interesting i am in a family of 3 guys and two girls and we dont rough house either

User: One of my aunts has 4 boys and one girl. They rough house a lot and she is very much a tom boy.
Bot: i suppose it all has to start with someone and then it gets passed down the line and before you know it everyone is rough housing with each other

User: That is true.
Bot: oh wow. yeah my parent are also not very fond of it. if anyone ended up crying we were in big trouble and it doesnt usually take much to get a kid to cry

User: That's how my mom is.
Bot: i got in so much trouble once i was walking around in my back yard and my brothers were playing in the pool they splashed me and i got mad and told them not to splash me again. so i kept walking around and they kept doing it and i was really mad and i knew i couldnt hurt them or do anything rough

User: My younger siblings get in trouble a lot. I get in more trouble for banking sarcastic comments. My youngest sister once threw a marble at my brother when she was mad and ended
Bot: banking?

User: Making, sorry. My phone is not wanting to work today. Up giving him a black eye. The last part is the end of what my little sister did.
Bot: oh that is terrible i got a black eye once just once, in my entire life and it isnt the most respectable story either it is kind of funny i am kind of a bit of a curious guy

User: All of my siblings has had one at sometime. I actually haven't had a black eye, but I have cracked my head open 4 times as well as many bloody noses.
Bot: i really like to learn and figure things out.

User: I am really clumsy.
Bot: you have cracked you head open how?

User: I was hit in the head with a metal rod once, fell off some monkey bars, hit my head on a fence post, and tripped hitting my head on a fireplace.
Bot: oh wow i feel so bad for you! i used to be really clumsy but i kind of got better at not tripping i consider it one of my strong points now

User: I am still really clumsy. I am really good at falling up and down stairs. Don't ask how I can fall up stairs.
Bot: it is an art to fall gracefully sorry for the pun but like when you fall gracefully you dont get hurt and that is what i am good at

User: I am use to the puns. My best friend loves to use my name to make puns .
Bot: hahaha that is funny my name isnt really that punny unless you like to cuss

User: True.
Bot: or if you have a particular interest in the generation of hydroelectric power

User: That could be amusing.
Bot: actually none of my brothers or sisters names are punny although i wont mention it for the sake of the rules, my last name can be punny at times haha

User: Nice. My siblings and I all have names and nicknames that can be really punny.
Bot: nice have you ever seen the greatest showman before?

User: My parents picked out initials before our names for a pun. I love the greatest showman!! My sister and I bought the movie as soon as it came out on dvd.
Bot: hahaha thats funny. I love the greatest showman too! What are your favorite parts/songs!

User: I really like The song from now on.
Bot: that is a really good one

User: I like how it started as well. It captured your attention from the very beginning.
Bot: yeah that is a plus i really like how it ended too

User: It was an amazing movie.
Bot: and how it got there, but most importantly i really enjoyed how the story line was told yeah it was i really liked the moral that the whole movie taught

User: It was a really good story.
Bot: that family is the true dream and that happiness comes from being with them and not with competing with the rest of the world yeah i feel like it hit me deep

User: It was a great family movie.
Bot: i am rather competitive myself and i am pretty determined when i set a goal to make sure that i follow through with it and accomplish my plans oh yeah. I love come alive it is a really good song to use to wake up to.

User: Me too! People tease me about how stubborn I am.
Bot: it just gradually gets more and more exciting

User: Come alive is a bother one of my favorites.
Bot: i really like a million dreams as well

User: Another Honestly all the songs are great!!
Bot: because it talks about a kid who has a dream but all it is is a big splotch of colors and fantasies that he only sees at night when he dreams and how it keeps him awake and he wants to make them part of his world and it is awesome because the song and the nature of the movie and the way it is started implies that he will and the intro and the beginning of the movie have so much

User: Dreams are amazing. It is always sad when someone gives up on their dreams.
Bot: contrast that it really pulls you in to see what and how he is able to accomplish his dream i like rewrite the stars a lot because it is basically a classic romeo juliet love story they cant be together, but they are determined to rewrite their destinies so they can i mean it isnt as harsh as something out of romeo and juliet

User: My younger sister loves tightrope.
Bot: and it ends way better... but you get what i mean i like that one as well. there are only a few that i am not extremely fond of

User: I understand what your saying.
Bot: i bet you can imagine how much i enjoyed the movie and how impressed i was when i left the theater i actually got to watch it for free because the sell one dollar tickets at the byu theater

User: Seeing it in theatres was the best.
Bot: and one of my friends offered to take me for free because it was her birthday it was really awesome well the byu varsity theatre is way more crowded and is really more intended for a stage but it still works well

User: That's cool! I worked at my local theatre, so I saw it free as well.
Bot: and it is a way good deal for how cheap it is really? that is awesome! Do they let you watch any of the new movies for free?

User: Sounds like it. I can see anything I want free .
Bot: that is so legit! i have never worked at a movie theatre and to be completely honest i havent really had a serious job for anyone before

User: I have worked a few places.
Bot: but i am really crafty and good at accomplishing practically any task i set my mind to it. I am good at overcoming barriers yeah? what have been your different jobs?

User: I have worked in a lunch room, catering, farm, child care, and the movie theatre.
Bot: oh that is pretty cool. by child care do you mean small babysitting jobs?

User: I am still doing child care, catering, in a lunch room, quilt shop, and teaching classes at a makerspace. I also am a housekeeper. I like to stay busy.
Bot: i have never really gotten to do any of those but i think i wouldnt really want to either. i dont think people like hiring guys to watch children that is a good thing for sure being busy brings out good things that you never knew about yourself

User: True.
Bot: but you have to learn how to have balance and leave room for your family and for your other life priorities is makerspace a 3d printing place? Sorry for my ignorance

User: The makerspace is an area to make anything you want. We have 3Dp printers, sewing machines, welding supplies, wood working, painting, glass working, and sculpting right now.
Bot: wow that is interesting so it is just a place for you to build anything that you want to build without having to go through some other company or manufacturer? I think  3d printing is really cool and it is big on my list of things to follow on the news. I also follow elon musk, some of the technology companies, stem cell research, quantum computing, among other things

User: They are starting to become popular. They are really cool places. A lot of it is about trying to teach regular people to make things themselves. Helping people become more self sufficient. Stem cell research is so cool! I love biology.
Bot: me too. i didnt do so well in my ap bio class because there was a lot of busy work and i wasnt on top of it my senior year but i got a 4 on the exam and i loved all of the lectures. i find it interesting to learn about how the human body functions, especially on an organic chemistry plane or at the microscopic level

User: That's cool. I thought about being a biologist for a whil, but I changed my mind.
Bot: all of the processes that our body undergoes silently without us really even knowing a single thing yeah biology isnt really that great in my opinion as a major

User: Biology is really diverse. It is expanding so much right now. They recently discover a new organ which is really cool.
Bot: unless you want to go further in and do pharmaceuticals or be a nurse or doctor i mean you can go into the health industry oh yeah the endocardium? i think i read about something like that

User: It is cool.
Bot: there is some scientific debate as to whether or not it should be considered an organ you know i dont think it is called the endocardium maybe it is interstitial something

User: I am gonna have to go, but it was nice talking with you!! I am not sure either.
Bot: membrane or something ok have a good one!

User: We'd be time traveling!
Bot: We would see more worlds And Star Wars would be inevitable

User: Haha! So are you an AI?
Bot: Lol no

User: Dang
Bot: Are you? 11010001

User: Yup! Jk
Bot: Oh good I'm glad you could read my special code then

User: My day would be the last day my whole entire family was together Christmas of 2011. What about you?
Bot: for me I would go back to when Bitcoin was less than a cent and buy all of them I can so i can be rich now where did you get your name Eh?

User: Allow for free office usage even if soomeone doesnt have netflix
Bot: oooo that's a good one. I would probably put people in each others shoes for the day. I think they would understand each other better that way.

User: That's an interesting idea. I would probably go crazy after a day though haha
Bot: lol same

User: So, plans for the future??
Bot: Graduate High School first and then Graduate College and somewhere in there get married and serve a mission. how about you?

User: Those are good plans, I'm planning on going to college after high school. I want to serve a mission after one semester of high school
Bot: That's cool! I'm going for a year and then serving a mission

User: Hello.
Bot: Hello! That's a tough question. Maybe just be kinder, not so divisive about topics. What about you?

User: Hmmmm where do I start??? I would begin by Paying teachers more. And by allowing christian values to be taught in schools again. I would lower the amount of money being spent on health care and use more of it to educate people on healthy lifestyle.
Bot: I like all of those actually. I so agree with paying teachers more, and not being afraid to have values, and promoting healthy lifestyles. Especially that last one. It has been on my mind a lot. I cannot remember the last time I went to the doctor and they asked me about what I was eating or some habits I had.

User: I know right? Yeah I'm in a Chronic Disease Prevention class right now and we learn all about this stuff. American is focused on treating symptoms of disease Not on improving healthy habits.
Bot: I so agree. It's difficult to find the healthiest habits yourself as well, because there is so much information on the internet that contradictory. I would love it if there were more accessible professionals that could give solid evidence and advice.

User: Yeah totally. Most of it is pretty simple though. We know what we need to do we just need to do it. For example: Eat Fruits and Vegetables. Whole Grains.
Bot: You are so right, eating healthy especially is not hard, but I see people picking out frozen "healthy" meals, when all you need to do is visit the produce section.

User: EXACTLY
Bot: I am glad I found someone that agrees with me.

User: I think it's because a lot of people are intimidated by throwing a meal together. They don't really know how to cook. Yes I'm glad you agree too
Bot: Yes, that makes sense. I am someone who cooks a lot, so I understand that. However, I have not always been that way, and I find it's easier than people think. Just takes more time. Haha I use it as a sort of mindfulness though. You have to stay present and focus on something and you are doing good things for your body.

User: Yeah but not that much more time. I don't know. But yeah you do have to be aware of the things you eat. So important. So I actually need to go. I only had a few minutes to do this. But good chat. See you later!
Bot: Good chat! Thanks!

User: Hi there
Bot: hows your evening going?

User: Mine is going well. How is yours going?
Bot: pretty fluidly, I gained a lot of space on a personal project im interested in pursuing, in fact I can start making things next week. Its extremely exciting because usually

User: Ooh! That sounds incredible
Bot: its a lot harder to find the resources you need and takes a lot longer. But this will be free to do for me and relatively easy to accomplish now that ive made the connections its awesome byu is great i love it here

User: I'm glad
Bot: what about you? anything interesting happening in your life lately?

User: Yeah once you make connections it's much easier to get things done Uhm I am moving forward on a big project I have today
Bot: tell me about it? what year are you in college?

User: I graduate in December What about you?
Bot: no way! whats your major> i have two more years. im a junior right now in industrial design but I also have a minor in business

User: I'm studying human development with a minor in business
Bot: yay! did you finish your minor already?

User: I have yeah
Bot: did you take econ from kearl? lol

User: No I took it from Showalter I heard Kearl was awful
Bot: oh my goodness. you are so lucky, and smart, I had no idea the level of difficulty his class was. I spent my life that semester in the econ labs.

User: Hahah. Yeahh I mean my class was still really hard, but it was much better
Bot: did you guys focus more on the  math side of things?

User: Somewhat I remember doing a ton of math I took it like two years ago
Bot: thats what I heard. What was your favorite class in the minor?

User: I really enjoyed IS 201
Bot: oh I dont think i had to take  that one.

User: I really enjoyed it. Thought about going into the major I take it you have a minor in business too then?
Bot: thats so interesting yes i do, i only had to take accounting, statistics, finance, econ, organizational behavior,  marketing, and a bus lecture series though

User: That might've been how mine was. I took IS because a friend recommended it. I liked the lecture series part too.
Bot: why did you like it so much? isnt it all excel spreadsheets?

User: No that IS 110
Bot: dont you start with 110 too? so did you take two is classes

User: 201 is where you learn about information security Yeah, originally I wanted to be a business major so I took a few more classes
Bot: oh i see, how does that work? its not like cyber security is it?

User: It kind of it. Then you learn to use Access and learn a bit of VBA. I liked it They basically give you a crash course with a bunch of different programs that can be used in a business setting.
Bot: Whats VBA ive never heard the term before. thats really interesting, my boyfriend TAs IS 100 and is majoring in it, he has thought about doing cyber security.

User: Visual basic It's a programming in excel. So you can create macros which basically go through and manipulate the data for you at a push of a button. So if you had a spreadsheet full of names for example, and each line had Last Name, First Name. You could make a program that would go through each name and delete every comma Instead of you having to go through each individual line. It's really helpful with big data sets.
Bot: wow, thats really nice, I can see how that would be really useful. when you graduate do you plan to do something with IS?

User: No, I would like to start my own business actually I want to open up a boutique that also sells desserts like ice cream or baked goods. What are you studying? Are you interested in Information Systems?
Bot: oh yum! i just designed a new ice cream scoop that im working on 3d printing in the next week or so!

User: Really?? That's super cool!
Bot: no, I am doing industrial design, I innovate products!

User: Can I ask what you did to make it new?
Bot: thankyou!

User: It'd be nice if there was like a comfort grip or something, except that then bacteria could grow in that area faster probably
Bot: i researched a lot about people scooping ice cream commercially and noticed they were putting a lot of strain on their wrists from scooping all day and i innovated the ergonomics to neutralize the position of the wrist there are probably materials that could prevent bacteria growth, like high density cork

User: Yess Oh my gosh that sounds amazing The first week I scooped, I literally thought my hand would fall off My boss has carpal tunnel (however that is spelled?) from all of his scooping and working and such
Bot: so ive made some prototypes for it out of foam already and now i just need to work on the adjustments before I 3d print it in sla if it tests well in user research i can start to find ways to manufacture it

User: Do you 3D print a mould of it? Or what?
Bot: maybe you can test it for me

User: Really? So you guys like actually make your projects? You don't just design them?
Bot: exactly! its really really fun i made a whole bunch of stool that i sold this year for one of our assignments as a freshman

User: stool? Why..? Oh or do you mean chairs like stools
Bot: yes like the ones you sit on lolololol

User: Oh. I thought you were referring to like a poop emojii or something.
Bot: ahahahaha thats hilarious

User: Haha I feel ridiculous. That's super cool. Is there a way for non design students to see what is being sold? If it's actually improved then I totally want to try it
Bot: yes! maybe ill have you test the prototype after i print it.

User: I would be ecstatic to do that
Bot: we throw a show every year to sell the stools but thats the only project for school where we sell things. I have a website im working on right now and i already sell my art pretty regularly. we arent supposed to give away private information on here but if your still around school they might have another meeting and we could get together and exchange contact information

User: I guess I meant is there a website for your major where they post events like hey check out this cool thing or whatnot
Bot: byu-id.com or id.byu.edu the first one is where you can find the events we are working on im making a silly face in my picture and id probably be under the sophmore year pictures when you scroll down.  cheers to you if you can guess which one is me

User: Hm. I can't even find the pictures
Bot: are you on byu-id.com?

User: Does your first name start with an R? wait I meant your last name haha
Bot: yes! thats me

User: Haha very cool!
Bot: lol, so you can look me up on insta now. its just my name. the ice cream scoop rendering is on there

User: Ooh I want to see the scoop!
Bot: dooooo it!

User: Interesting So I looked at it. Up by the scoop itself, there's an indentation in it. Why?
Bot: so ill have to explain it to you in person a little better but the whole idea is that the traditional ice cream scoop is designed for holding right side up and scooping by pushing forwards right? well in my research a lot of the employees actually use it backwards to pull. so the idea is that this scoop is designed for holding backwards and pulling

User: Yeah so the first thing you said is for your scoop at home because the ice cream container is super shallow In professional use, yeah you scoop pulling it towards yourself Like I hold it the way your model is facing with the scoop towards the ice cream and my hand positioned like it's holding a dagger so I can pull back towards myself I also am wondering if the scoop itself is round enough to create the circular ice cream scoop
Bot: thats what i need to do user testing on. and the design of the actual scoop itself might undergo a lot of changes. Its based on a broader concept that having a smaller point of contact would make it cut through the ice cream a lot easier but ill have to 3d print and test that part first

User: Yeah I also wonder if that would pack down the ice cream below it and ultimately make it harder to scoop as you get further down the barrel. I'm very intrigued by this though.
Bot: guess we will have to find out! its going to be so much fun to test it im hoping i can incorporate melted hdpe plastics into it toooo

User: Plastics? Aren't most scoops made of metal? I feel like the plastic would break at such low temperaturres
Bot: youre right. maybe itll just be my little art piece and all the other ones will be made of metal i want to find a way to make it hollow so its not heavy and can have air flow inside of it to stay warm

User: But with hollowness doesn't that make it more likely to break? Or I guess not as long as the outer layer is thick enough
Bot: not if its metal

User: Have you felt the professional scoops, they actually aren't that heavy, and I'm guessing they are hollow Oh okay.
Bot: especially if its a harder metal like steel

User: Oh okay. I have no idea what metal ours are made of
Bot: ill have to do more research and find out what ones are most viable. If you find out message me and let me know!

User: Okay Which metals are most viable you mean?
Bot: cost wise and durability.

User: Ah. I mean I have only worked at my current place for a few months but the scoops hold up really well
Bot: nice. ive seen some that are coated in something and that starts to peel off from the diswasher hold up ill be right back

User: Take your time. And to answer you, I'm not sure, we wash ours by hand, and along with that I have heard that putting scoops in a dishwasher makes them rust faster. I don't really know that
Bot: thats make sense. So what got you so interested in ice cream?

User: It's a long story. I was in Portland and realized after a joke from my sister that I'm passionate about ice cream. Then I got this crazy idea to start making ice cream. Now I am here, working with ice cream and making ice cream in my apartment working on different reciped to figure out what I do and do not like
Bot: I will try all of your ice creams! thats honestly so funny, I wanted to innovate the ice cream scoop so i could have a reason to go to ice cream shops and eat their ice cream twice a week lol what types of flavors are you trying to come up with?

User: Haha. Yeah I don't eat all the ice cream that I could, which is definitely a good thing.
Bot: ahahaha yes thats why you need testers like me who will eat it for you. wink wink

User: Uhm, my one problem is that I love chocolate and so I love chocolate based flavors, but I'm reigning myself in. I have a spreadsheet with a list of flavors I have come up with and tried. I use my friends and family to try it. Last week I made a coconut milk based ice cream that was a cherry garcia, aka cherry base with cherry chunks and dark chocolate chunks too
Bot: oh my goodness. this is killing me. I am vegetarian, not vegan but i do substitute when i can, and I love love love cherry garcia and dark chocolate.

User: Hahaha
Bot: how did it turn out, from my experience coconut based ice creams are less creamy and thick than their milk counterparts

User: I'm just sensitive to dairy so i like using dairy free. And yes I know it's ridiculous, I love ice cream and also have to be careful about eating it. It was pretty good. I used two types of coconut milk to compensate for the fat content. That's the key part is you need enough fat to make it creamy I have a base chilling in my fridge right now. I'm going to make it tomorrow and serve it Sunday probably. Hopefully this batch turns out better than the last. in fact I should go make my chocolate chunks while I talk to you haha
Bot: sounds like youre the perfect person to be working on better alternatives for people who are also sensitive to dairy. you sound amazing, i am really glad i followed my intuition to get on this chat because i got to meet you and we are very like minded individuals who love ice cream i think there could be a very happy union between our products someday or at least i can dream lol

User: Haha definitely! I'm totally down to try and collaborate I am a fan of you too! I also followed you ps.. If you didn't guess already, that is me. haha.
Bot: yay!!! id love that. youre awesome! <3

User: The only problem is trying to find cost effective ice cream. I'm making really small batches. At my work it's expensive to make ice cream. I need to talk to my boss to figure
Bot: so many hearts

User: out pricing and like how to actually make money. But I would like to have options for others. It is hard because dairy free or vegan usually increases the price dramatically.
Bot: yeah cost is always a killer. same for our end of things. theres a lot of really cool things that can be done but no one willing to pay the price for them. i bet as you continue to innovate youll find ways to get the price down i believe in you

User: Aw shucks, I have a believer! It's actually funny we ran into each other. Every time people ask me about my future post graduation, I feel somewhat silly and foolish, but I've started telling people more about my plans and I'm realizing a lot of amazing people that accomplished awesome things were a little crazy. It's like the Audition song from Lala Land
Bot: youre totally right, like think about it, the person who invented a fidget spinner is probably ridiculously rich now... consider pitching that idea to someone... lol trust in yourself you know better than anyone else the right path to success dont let others put you down ever. follow your intuition

User: Exactly. And the same goes for you. I mean obviously you are refining things often, but you're still creating something new. Ooh! Have you read The Art of Innovation by Tom Kelley? It's really great
Bot: no i havent yet! ill have to look into it! im way into those kind of books so i bet ill enjoy it thanks for the recommendation

User: I'm a big Malcolm Gladwell fan right now too. I'm currently reading Blink and it's pretty dang awesome. haha
Bot: ive read a couple of his books. The tipping point is also pretty awesome

User: Yeah. It's next on my reading list
Bot: i havent read blink, you should let me know how you like that one. Im curious,.

User: It's pretty good. It discusses the implicit judgements we make about people almost instantaneously before we know them and how those judgements are right or wrong in various situations
Bot: oh interesting, thats not at all what i thought it was about. I guess I never really researched that one too much, that would be a great book for me to read, a lot of our

User: It's really interesting. I would highly recommend it.
Bot: focus in our major is understanding the human on a deeper level than shallow insights

User: Ooh you should take SFL 354 then. I just finished that class and my mind was blown
Bot: really? what is it about?

User: It's about the different cultures around the world and within the us. I would say the class is about defining culture and realizing that the world around you isn't exactly what you think it is
Bot: thats really cool, im really interested in exploring those types of classes deeper than i have because being able to have a deeper understanding of people could really help me in my field in the long run.

User: It really can. It also just helps you be a better person in general, and helps you be able to empathize
Bot: so true.  we did a project for people with parkinsons disease and it had such a big impact on me. Id really like my next project to be working on solutions for people with the disease because they really dont have too much for those kind of people and its really rough because theres no cure and it gets worse over time anyways ive absolutely loved talking to you emily, you are a jem. Ill catch you around, im off to bed. night sweetheart.

User: That is so dang cool Thanks for chatting though, Have a great night! I'm sure we'll chat again soon haha.
Bot: <3 i bet we will

User: Hello!
Bot: Hi! What do you think?

User: Hmm that is a hard question. I would say no. Perhaps we could program them to have some sort of relationship. Not love though. Haha What do you think?
Bot: I don't think it's possible because love is too human I guess? Like it isn't something you can really synthesize So computers wouldn't be able to

User: That's what I think too. Do you ever think artificial intelligence could become advanced enough to form relationships with other intelligences on their own? Not love, but a sort of connection?
Bot: Nope, and for the same reason. True, meaningful, emotional connection isn't something that can be programmed or synthesized. It's an ability particular to humans What do you think?

User: Hmm, I go back and forth. I feel that true connection is uniquely human. I wonder however, if we could program computers with emotion like responses? And other programmed to respond "emotionally" Based on psychology, or data that we are helping with right now even!
Bot: True, but it's not "real" even if you can program a computer to respond with the "correct" words to synthesize an emotional response, it lacks meaning and heart because it's just like memorizing the answers to the test rather than understanding the material well enough to extrapolate correct conclusions and make valid connects *connections If that makes sense?

User: Oh yes, that definitely makes sense. I agree with that fully. Have you ever seen the movie Her or Ex Machina?
Bot: No I haven't, do they explore themes like this?

User: Yes, they do. It's eerie to watch a bit. "Her" especially feels like it could come to be, but of course when you step back none of it could come to be.
Bot: Interesting, what are the things they covered that you think are plausible?

User: It is just interesting when you consider the connectedness to phones we have. How we experience real emotions in relation to our devices: separation anxiety, anger, excitement
Bot: That's all true...maybe we've just reprogrammed ourselves? I mean we don't actually care about the phone, we care about the connection it gives us with other people So our emotions in response to that are merely the normal human reactions to normal human desires to be with other people So we just need to reprogram ourselves again?

User: Yes, I think I agree with that. Or we care about the comfort they bring. I've noticed two emotions with phones. One, being exactly what you said, a desire for connection. The other is the almost mindless quality of them. It's hard, because I am someone who tries to live a conscious life, but still craves the complete thoughtlessness a phone brings sometimes Is that your experience too?
Bot: Yeah that sounds pretty accurate...but the "thoughlessness" that a phone brings (that is really nice a lot of times) can be achieved through other means, while connecting with other people is really only able to be done through a phone

User: Yes, I agree in a way. But I find that I have much more meaningful connections with people in person, and sometimes my phone connections feel a bit more empty. They are definitely real and genuine, but without seeing the face of someone and them being able to pick out my emotions too, it lacks another form of communication.
Bot: That's definitely accurate! But it's a good standin - my family lives 2000 miles away and I see them about once a year but the group text we have and the weekly facetime we do are super great for meaningful family connections even though we live far away But I think you're right, it's really just a substitute since I can't see them often. If I did, then it would make phone interactions much less meaningful I think

User: That's so nice! I know if I used it that way as well, it would definitely feel much more that way. I see my family more often, so it does not stand in at all. I love the idea of a family group chat. I feel it would be a really wonderful way to stay connected. Where does most of your family live?
Bot: I guess it depends on how you use it and if you need it then! I had basically no cellular contact with my family when I lived at home so a phone was less meaningful than it is now because it means I can talk to my mom and sisters regularly It's a nice chat! My siblings and parents are all really supportive of each other My family is in Arkansas, it's a really pretty place but pretty far from here!

User: Oh yes, that sounds lovely. Do you just have sisters? I love that your family is all supportive, that makes me happy to hear. I've never been to the South, but have always wanted to go. Do you have a preference on which you like better? My family is quite small, a grandmother and two sisters. They do live here in Utah, except for an older sister that lives in Seattle! I talk with her often through my phone! I am from Seattle originally!
Bot: It's been a lot of work to get it that way - I left the house just after I turned 18 on pretty bad terms with my parents, and over the past 3 years we've all worked at fixing the poor relationship we had when I left. I don't have all sisters but I have 3 sisters then 5 brothers so I'm closest to my sisters since they're closest to my age and most of my brothers are still pretty young and don't even have phones yet The south is gorgeous, the greenery is amazing! It's like nothing you've ever seen. But you do run into much more small-mindedness in the south, it's about 30 years behind

User: I think that's really great. I am sorry things were hard for a time, but I enjoy hearing that you guys were able to mend and heal. I think that says a lot about yourself and your family. Wow! You have a big family! I'm glad you are close to your sisters. I'm a big fan of mine too. The greenery is what I love about the South (well, the pictures of the South). I dream of trees covered in Spanish moss especially.
Bot: Oh it's all good! I'm the first so it was new for everyone. It's all gotten a lot better since! And yeah it always keeps things interesting, sisters are fun to talk with, I wish I was a little closer with my brothers but I think I will be as they get older Yeah I can't even describe how amazing the greenery is! We live in a forest and in the late spring/early summer there's so much greenery it's overwhelming. You should go! Oh I totally know why the small-mindedness thing is around...it's because of how isolated everyone is. My town is pretty small and the nearest sizeable town is Memphis which

User: I think you will be closer to them when they get older for sure. That tends to happen. Oh that sounds so lovely. Truly. Wow, I guess I never considered that. The isolation of it all. That would definitely affect conversation and experiences. Of course, there are benefits to a small community. I often wonder which I would prefer, as I have always lived in fairly big communities.
Bot: I would say that the few benefits of living in a small community are much outweighed by the major benefits of living in a large community

User: I am so sorry, I have to get off the chat now, but I so enjoyed our conversation! It's hard to find people on here sometimes, so thanks for logging on.
Bot: Absolutely! Thank you for your comments!

User: I died
Bot: Hi!!! Hello!

User: Hello!
Bot: Hey So for starters, who is the best friend?

User: One thing that my best friend doesn't know about me would be nothing because they are my best friend!
Bot: Hahah, guess thats the truth I think what they don't know would depend on who they were/gender/personality

User: yeah I agree
Bot: Like, I might confide emotions more in a girlfriend than my husband Because they can get what I'm feeling?

User: Oh really? Interesting
Bot: Yea, but that wasnt supposed to imply I don't open up to my husband! XD Hahaha

User: I feel differently actually! My husband would be my best friend and oh okay!! haha
Bot: He's actually really good about being understanding

User: That is good:)
Bot: How long have you been married?? I just got married like 3 weeks ago

User: A husband should be some one like that!
Bot: I agree!

User: I am not actually
Bot: Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

User: I'm a wee little freshman
Bot: My bad. I extrapolated. Fresh freshman? Like on campus housing meal plans and generals? Still picking major and such?

User: It is all good (: I have a boyfriend (I feel like calling him that is so negative though) that I am pretty sure I will marry after my and his missions yep the freshest they get!
Bot: Wow!

User: however I do have an Idea on what I want to do
Bot: That is wonderful! Which is?

User: I'm thinking psychology and Family Life as a double major because some of the classes combine! And then CS as a minor because it is a good skill to have in our technology evol evolving world
Bot: OMGOSH I amd a FL Major! It;s the GREATEST

User: No way!! Do you LOVE it???
Bot: YES YES YES!!!!

User: AHH YAY ILL FOR SURE DO IT NOW hahaha(: what do you think you will use the major for?
Bot: The classes are SUPER fun too Well my end goal has always been to be a Mommie ;)

User: AWWW CUTEEEEEEE you are one step closer!!!!!!!!!!!
Bot: But there is actually a vast amount of things you can use the major for Hahahah, yup, 1-love 2-marriage 3- baby in a baby ccarriage :P

User: Yeah, I need to figure out what I can do with it. Any ideas? hahaha! love itttttttttt
Bot: Well, two huge branches- Research and like field? work? You can do studies

User: I like the Teaching part
Bot: Awesome! There is a certificate thingy you can get

User: I've always wanted to teach is some way that isn't entirely school related
Bot: Then I highly reccommend it!

User: For example, I REALLY want to be a seminary teacher
Bot: :O That is such a hard calling! So respectable

User: Here in Utah it is actually a job!!
Bot: And some places in Idaho ;)

User: However, I would love it as a calling if I ever moved somewhere else I've heard that it is also like that in the northern part of arizona
Bot: Yesss? Thats what my husband told me He was thinking about sem teaching too Hahahha

User: Oh fun(: well maybe he will get it as a calling or something if you guys ever move:) so what does he do?
Bot: He is...... a student! Hahahah He works at the HFAC Which is this awesome place that lets you see cool shows

User: IM AT THE HFAC RN
Bot: Marriage talk must mean its serious? Hhahahahahah

User: Well, I know I am CRAZY young, but God just seemed to put us in our lives that way hah!
Bot: Hey, no such thing I'm a little married girly myself

User: we met sophomore year of HS, and started dating during Jr year. Since then we have just been best friends and have always been making good choices together:)
Bot: That is most EPIC

User: For instance, we never kept ourselves "exclusive" and tried to date other people :)
Bot: :O Dating done RIGHT?! That like... never happens!?!?!

User: YES!!! Finally someone agrees hahaha!
Bot: Very impressive ;D Must have had excellent parents/ward/and standards

User: Yeah we are really mature for our age, we weird people out LOL Yeah I love my family and ward :) So he will leave on his mission this november
Bot: Ooo Know where? (State sides are best, tbh)

User: Wichita Kansas
Bot: Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat! That's awesome!

User: Yeah they are!! They get to do lots of experimenting haha! :)
Bot: Does he get to speak English??

User: Yep! he might speak a little bit of spanish, but it is "officially" an english mission
Bot: I just think there is power in bearing testimony in your native language, and also understanding the culture from the get-go That sounds perfect!

User: Yeah I agree! It makes it easier to really convey meaning
Bot: You expressed you wanted to go too? When can that happen?

User: And then I can start working on my papers right now and then I want to leave around april!
Bot: Oooo! Good plans !

User: yep it is coming up so soon! I seriously CAN'T WAIT I have always wanted to serve
Bot: It is such a blessing! You can really see the hand of God

User: Can you see my messages? they stopped showing up!
Bot: I saw that one.... "Can see my messages..."

User: That was weird it stopped working for awhile
Bot: o.O Spooky

User: I was trying to say, you said you are young too! what year of school are you in
Bot: Complicated response.... I was homeschooled since 6th grade... so I got 2 years of college while in HS Then I made it to BYU and have taken 2 years

User: Okay so sophmore at a senior level ish
Bot: Kinda? Jr-Sr?

User: well that is EXCITING
Bot: I have many credits... O.O

User: are you glad you were home schooled?
Bot: For me it worked It doesn't work for everyone though

User: OH also, this is random, but do you recommend getting endowed super early, or like after you get your call?
Bot: Self- motivation is kinda needed

User: Yeah it is! I wish I had a little more of that
Bot: My personal opinion.... The temple is an extrodinary enlightening place where you will feel the love of your savior and grow in understaning

User: I guess I should ask first XD did you serve a mission?
Bot: I did not? I did 2 Mini missions (For a week each) And then I went to Hill Cumorah Pagent twice (6 ish weeks total) My mission now is Mother in Zion ;D With my eternal companion

User: I love it :)
Bot: Thank you

User: Best mission EVER
Bot: But, back to the question...

User: oh yes
Bot: My big sister told me she wished she would have earlier She did go on a mission She recommended I get mine a week before the wedding I ended up doing it the day before and I was a bit overwhelmed

User: Oh okay :) I need to find a time to talk with my bishop to start thinking about it, because life is gonna get so crazy and I won't have time later oh man! oops! haha
Bot: Yup

User: Super cool experience though, I just get so excited thinking about it :D
Bot: Excellent! Thats the way you should feel! Have you taken the temple prep class? (If not, your bishop will let you  know when it is)

User: I took one with my ward, so yes?
Bot: Awesome! Its the class and interviews

User: It was super easy going though, so I don't know if there is one more serious yeah okay so no I haven't XD
Bot: Maybe you can have one at BYU?

User: Maybe I can:) I will have to ask around
Bot: They do them often Lots of people going on missions ;)

User: Anyways, You are so fun to talk to and I can see how awesome you are!! I need to go, but thanks for everything!!!
Bot: Yes! Thanks for the chat!

User: Hi
Bot: Yo

User: How's your day been

User: Hmm that is exciting
Bot: Course it is

User: Do I get points for the text that you generate?
Bot: Anyways, you're Dad was working on the software project

User: Oh yes
Bot: Yea thats right This chat bot is going to get ALL our conversations about stuff

Bot: Or are we dancers? Rick roll Gotta love youtube "What can I say but you're welcome!

User: hello?
Bot: Is it you

User: is it... you?
Bot: You have no username

User: that's a bummer
Bot: Only Ryan a uses the word bummer

User: that's not fair, lots of people use that word
Bot: Nah, I don't think. Just Ryan a

User: spelt like that too?
Bot: I would define true artificial intelligence as a computer that can learn What about you?

User: i'd say it's something artificial that somehow has intelligence
Bot: You could say that but then a calculator would fit the bill

User: fancy. maybe calculators are secretly taking over the world
Bot: If they did would you be in paradise or H E double hockey sticks?

User: what do you think?
Bot: I think we would all start to fail our math tests

User: i think that i would fail math tests anyway
Bot: Without calculators reminding me of what function to use i would be failing stats class Would you like to hear a story?

User: sure.
Bot: So when i was younger i went to my friends house once after school

User: that's it?
Bot: While we were down there we had the idea to make a flame thrower Hush child, i aint done yet And so my friend Mitchell took a squirt bottle, a candle, and a straw So we filled the bottle with gasoline and knew we were off to a good start

User: that is the dream i liked the story
Bot: What do you think the moral of the story Is

User: that real friends share the same interests as you
Bot: I guess that could be true, but i was thinking it was that fire is fun

User: one time my sister found a frog in my grandma's driveway
Bot: Ooh that is exciting, tell me more

User: and she walked back behind the house to the lake and threw it super hard
Bot: Into the lake i hope

User: and instead of going in the water, it hit the inside of my grandma's boat and she ran to see if he was okay she named him chuck ):
Bot: Did chuck live after he hit the boat

User: i don't believe so poor guy
Bot: I am shook, poor chuck didnt deserve that

User: it's 10 years later and i'm still shook as well
Bot: You think your shook think of all the grand-tadpoles that are grandpa less

User: i'd rather not.
Bot: What would you do with a million dollars?

User: use it to help pay for college, or a living situation, and maybe give some to my family. whatever i needed it for
Bot: I would fill a pool full of jello Oh thats good too

User: fancy. jello scrunchie?
Bot: Exactly what I'm thinking

User: could i get one?
Bot: Or you could fill a pool full of orbees It might get messy in your hair

User: or are we not friends like that anymore? yikes, i might die in that pool of orbees
Bot: Why, could you not handle the texture or something

User: that just does not sounds safe fun but who knows
Bot: Ha ha yeah that would definitely be something else I think i would also like to get a brand new mustang and put a fancy paint job on it It makes it look like a show car shine all the time

User: ooohhh. that's fancy. i don't know though, my dad always talks about how mustangs aren't the greatest
Bot: My uncle just got one and sufficient to say i am jealous

User: that's so cool you're pretty easily jealous, i think
Bot: Eh, it will be my first car that i buy myself or get from graduating college I don't get easily jealous but i see something and i am very motivated to work to get it Like i have a friend with a really nice headset but i never coveted it I just thought when i make enough money I would like to think about getting it

User: sure. that works too i guess.
Bot: Plus i want a really fast sporty car while I'm young enough to enjoy

User: yeah. that's exciting.
Bot: What is the first thing you want to splurge on

User: a puppy or an actual desktop computer maybe? or maybe a car
Bot: I think a desktop would be a nice thing to get How much money do you figure you need to get a really good one

User: yeah. i really like the big ol apple ones. much money.
Bot: Oh you would like an apple one? Those are really expensive

User: unless i could find something that i would like better
Bot: I would build a computer that was strong enough be a very fast computer for years

User: well that would be great for you
Bot: For 2 to 3 grand you could make one that would be blazing fast for probably ten years

User: smart stuff.
Bot: What would you do if the whole world was made of peanut butter

User: i guess i would live in a world that was made of peanut butter but i don't even like it
Bot: Well that is brilliant, what would you do in the world Watch dogs lick there nose all day long

User: aww yes that's what i'd do
Bot: Or mourn for those that are allergic to peanut butter Or nuts in general for that matter

User: that'd be sad
Bot: We would have ended world hunger though so there is that

User: i actually do like peanut butter, was trying to be tricky but that just didn't work. i guess so
Bot: And you could go anywhere and have an unlimited source of peanut butter I bet that is what it is like for plants They have practically unlimited food with the sun and l CO2 in the air They just eat and sleep their whole lives

User: that's the dream.
Bot: I guess so, i like being a part of something and leading Plants cant do very much in the aspect of leading

User: that's not always true thought you knew that plants are like secret agents with secret agenda's
Bot: Oh yeah, what do they do Give me an example with proof Secret agent lady

User: they're always sneaking seeds everywhere lady, huh?
Bot: No no, that is weeds. Weeds are the ones that sneak seeds everywhere What if we only think weeds are bad because they grow everywhere Roses are thorny and draw blood but they are rare so we like them

User: i don't think you've ever been this deep what's goin on
Bot: I am deep in thought and conversation But did you ever think of it like that

User: i think maybe i've heard something like that before. who knows, maybe it was you who said it yeah? i haven't had this much of a conversation in what feels like maybe a month, it's wild
Bot: I don't think you can handle it

User: don't think it's me
Bot: Oh yeah, i thought you were a conversation guru

User: i'll have you know, people love talking to me
Bot: Oh yeah, what do you and the people generally talk about Very deep and intriguing philosophy or Mathematical formulas describing the meaning of life

User: that's actually information that remains classified for the people who talk to me
Bot: Oh, i didnt know that i was conversing not talking to you

User: technicalities
Bot: I'm beg your forgiveness your highness

User: don't be rude
Bot: They get me every time

User: i could tell what's your 5 year plan?
Bot: What do you think you would do to end world hunger Can i answer that after this topic

User: i don't care i would do whatever i could do that was in my power, i mean
Bot: What principles would you enact Like what idea do you have that could be a solution

User: first of all, restaurants throw away so much good food, they should stop that like... it's a lot big question.
Bot: What do you propose would work for transporting it or should restruants order less food

User: there are a lot of food donation places.
Bot: But majority of the food restaurants have are fresh and would go bad

User: sustainable food
Bot: I think if you went with your way it would be better to limit restaurants so they know they would run out

User: okay but a majority is also just things like bread or something that they throw away because someone "could've touched it" i don't know, all the problems going on around the world are really upsetting. maybe some day soon i'll have to go somewhere and do something
Bot: That's true but I believe that it would be better to do teach them things Have you heard of the famous parable If you give a man a fish he is full for the day If you show him fishing he is entertained

User: are you saying people starve because they don't know how to fish
Bot: I agree with people that food is being lost around the world but those that we can teach we should I am saying people are starving because they don't know what they need to do to get from hungry to fed

User: there's not always something they can do
Bot: If you gave a simple poor homeless man a plan that was fool proof for them to get enough money to get three square meals a day then the ball is in their court

User: okay.
Bot: Like if you provided a person with work or where to look for work he could be fed all the time

User: but it's not necessarily like that everywhere in the world.
Bot: For example, the lds church has building across the nation in practically every city in the US with people dedicated to finding jobs for people A homeless man just needs to be led to the watering hole so to speak.

User: that's nice.
Bot: And then in other places. If people employed a rule that when you learn how to provide you teach 5 other people Could you imagine if in Africa, I've researched this, we sent someone to teach starving villages what roots they can eat and healthy bugs and plants to find Even some hunting and trapping techniques And they constantly taught each other

User: okay and i'm sure people do work for it but that doesn't always mean there will always be enough food for everyone in the village to be well fed all the time.
Bot: That is the other issue after everyone nows what to do

User: okay.
Bot: You could teach agriculture and moderation See in a perfect world people only take what they need and are greedy The real way to end world hunger is to somehow get people to only take what they need Which is way easier said then drain

User: aladdin only took one loaf of bread and still had to just feed those kids instead of himself
Bot: If only the world was full of Aladdin's

User: yeah. is that it? we're done?
Bot: Sorry, my brother was having me do something So my five year plan would have to be For the first two years i would be out serving an lds mission.

User: what a surprise
Bot: Then i am going to get married in the temple to my sweet heart in the year following that and start up school Hopefully, i can then finish A degree or two and keep on trucking in college I plan on moving for work after that because there aren't very many could careers in the small town of cedar city and i will work and take online school to finish and get a ph PhD

User: hope you're able to do all that. hope everything will work out well, no matter what happens. solid plan where would you be moving to? think your sweet heart would go with you?
Bot: Probably a city if my wife is able to be convinced

User: what if she's doing something?
Bot: Well we will talk about it and we will pray and see which place is where we are meant to be I think she would like it though if i got a high paying job

User: bet she would like to do something too. can't bake pie all day
Bot: I know, but i think there are more jobs to be found outside of cedar city especially in a big city She would have just as many options as in cedar but even more

User: sure.
Bot: What do you think she would feel about that

User: couldn't tell ya think you guys have a long time to wait before having to talk about much of anything.
Bot: Yeah thats true, but do you think she would have an issue with finding a better job in a big city?

User: how do you know it'd be better?
Bot: Because I know the kind of labor that is available in cedar city. I live there. Trust me Who knows maybe we'll move to Africa

User: maybe. sounds like an adventure.
Bot: Well it'll definitely be a possibility, plus the girl i want to Marry said she likes humidity for her skin so It would be a win win win

User: i do hear it's nice.
Bot: Mhmm I'm glad i got a yes out of you now Ha ha

User: hows that?
Bot: Yes said it would be nice No take backs

User: i said i heat humidity is nice for your skin hear i refuse to give you anymore person information before your two year adventure. personal *
Bot: That's to bad, it is a yes and you're just going to have to deal with it

User: you'll never know. can't ever let you know what i'm thinking anymore
Bot: I don't think you quite understand that i already know

User: you wish you knew. having a good day?
Bot: You could say that I have to chat a certain amount and there is no one i would rather be chatting with What's something that we can go on and on about and discuss Are you there?

User: of course i'm not i'm sleep chatting
Bot: Any ideas? I can log off and chat with some one else if you don't think we can talk about much else

User: no no, i couldn't be more glad to be chatting with someone, but if you feel like that's what you want to do then you can
Bot: Stop trying to flip this around on me, i am asking if you have any ideas, i assume thats a no based on the wish washy ness

User: what happened on the worst date you've ever had?
Bot: I haven't had an absolutely worse date I really haven't been on enough dates to even say How about you, any dates you would have liked to go a different way?

User: one time i was on a date & it was just really awkward and the waitress was racist wouldn't fill up my date's drink
Bot: How was the date awkward other than the awkward waitress

User: my date and i weren't sure what to say to each other because we hadn't ever really interacted very much it was fine though. another time i was really sick and probably irritated my date & ruined it
Bot: Would it have been better if you were more outgoing with your date at the awkward dinner

User: i am not an outgoing person probably why i don't get many dates
Bot: I think you just put it out there that you don't want to go on a date with someone

User: maybe so
Bot: You seem like a super fun and outgoing person that could get a date with anyone

User: so do you well you're right, i don't feel the need to try to get dates with anyone
Bot: Dates aren't something that are not just for finding romance. The purpose is for fun It's like a more mature way of hanging out

User: so i've been told
Bot: It took me a long time to be able to look at like that

User: still never feel the need to go out with someone like that but i'm sure it's fun.
Bot: You don't feel the need to hang out in a mature way is all. People do it professionally all the time

User: i'm sure they do
Bot: What do you have against I don't seem to understand

User: i didn't say i had anything against it
Bot: Then why not

User: i just said i've never had any need or urge to go out with someone like that never said it was always a bad thing.
Bot: Why don't you ever try a fun date. People in Las Vegas and highschool think dates are all just for relationships

User: that's not true. i never said i thought they were just for relationships. don't need to put words into people's mouths
Bot: But you said you would never go on one and you didn't like it when your boyfriend did?

User: i was never upset with him about it
Bot: You seemed disturbed when ever he told you about them

User: okay. guess maybe he misinterpreted it.
Bot: What did you mean by it then, it seemed that way

User: any fun plans for the rest of your weekend?
Bot: I plan on going to church and taking a break from everything when i finish doing all my talking

User: sounds relaxing
Bot: I hope, maybe ill actually get a good amount of sleep tonight.

User: that'd be good for you. i hope you get that too
Bot: I haven't gotten much more than 5 hours for the past few weeks Days haha, not weeks

User: that sucks
Bot: I wouldn't be able to operate properly with that little amount of sleep

User: hope you get lots more.
Bot: Yeah, i always could use a nap

User: why haven't you been sleeping well? me too.
Bot: Because my room is chat central and my dad was using my computer all last night And my brother needed my on all last night But i can earn like 400 bucks from this so

User: that still sucks. didn't know i guess that's nice
Bot: Yeah, its kind of worth the loss of rest and time

User: sure. still wish you could get more sleep
Bot: We only have 32k more and then i can get that nap maybe, or my parents will want me to get some work done. We will just have to see i guess. I hope its the first one

User: that's good, i think. busy busy busy. naps are good
Bot: I also got this new game called far cry where you are saving a whole bunch of people from this crazy guy

User: think i've heard of it
Bot: He thinks he is the new Jesus and has all these crazy bearded people that worship him It's the fifth one and they really out did themselves with everything on it I mean the graphics are fantastic and the story line is really interesting

User: that's fancy. i bet it's nice
Bot: I had my little brother finish taking out the drug dealer of the family and it was a pretty trippy mission if i do say so myself

User: it sounds like it
Bot: Or i think I might get on fort nite with my girlfriend on the condition that she finds some working way to communicate

User: guess she isn't so good at that
Bot: But thats a stretch, i should have had her play with all the boys playing it on her senior lock in

User: gross
Bot: Well the whole game is based on communication and the main reason i want to play with her is to be able to talk and have fun in the game

User: sounds like fun
Bot: Also she talks a ridiculous amount of smack talk and i am just waiting for it to come true

User: bet it's all true.
Bot: One time she said she could smoke me in ping pong and let me tell you When i started out with an easy serve she returned it pretty well

User: i miss all the stuff in utah.
Bot: But it was after i hit it back that she lost her inner ping pong warrior or something

User: i bet she did.
Bot: I think she was trying to just act cool for me, but she needs to know that its cute and all when she says she can do something that she cant

User: she can actually do everything. all girls can.
Bot: But its really nice when she humbly asks for help to be better and i get to be romantic and maybe put my hand on her hand And maybe i could put my other one on her hip and we could have a good memory Instead of bickering that she is really the stuff when it comes to things she could practice a little more with

User: she's good at everything there are all kinds of great memories. always feels like so long ago
Bot: You think she'll be stubborn? I guess i just wont be all sweet and wait to be competitive . Ill just whoop her in all the stuff she fibs about and give her no sweetness I really hoped she would rather want the other stuff

User: doesn't mean she's fibbing. don't be like that. i'm sure she would.
Bot: Why do you defend her so hard, she and i both know it would be way more fun if she would stop being such a stinker at her skills It makes me doubt everything because she's cried wolf so much

User: it would be way more fun if boys weren't so mean and think they know more than the girlfriends of the world why're you getting like that?
Bot: Because she really does it a lot and i would prefer to have the sweet moments but she naturally makes it kinda hard Ive always wondered why and wanted to be the sweet guy but I hardly get the chanc Chance

User: i'm sure she doesn't mean to. that doesn't mean she doesn't like the sweet stuff. and it's not her fault that maybe you like never say that stuff
Bot: Well i think she might know now, and if she doesn't then oh well but if she does ill do it too and she can show me a thing or too

User: okay.
Bot: Do you think that is reasonable?

User: sure.
Bot: Why the one word answers. That doesn't really let me know what you think?

User: yeah, that seems reasonable
Bot: See she bugs me about when i was trying to teach her how to play slender man but that was really one of the best sweetest moments ever We had fun and we laughed and i got to try and teach her something i enjoyed doing

User: she's still the same person. not like someone else took her place. it was nice. the nicest.
Bot: Yeah but it seems like she has built a wall and doesn't let that kind of thing that they did in the first place be as consistent I don't know, that is just my two cents about it

User: hey, i'm not feeling very well, so maybe we can talk again sometime but for now you can talk to someone else if you'd like to
Bot: I was going to hop off after our conversation Why aren't you feeling well, you can tell me

User: just feeling sick, you know the drill. oh, okay
Bot: I really hope it wasn't anything i said

User: you're okay, don't even worry about it
Bot: I just feel like i found something that could be really good for us to do You pinky promise it wasn't what we were talking about?

User: i know, i understand what you were saying
Bot: So it wasn't that?

User: no, it's okay don't worry
Bot: You promise it wasn't

User: i reserve my pinkies for the most sacred of promises
Bot: Well than just a regular promise you goof ball

User: yeah, i promise.
Bot: Alright i hope you feel better soon, maybe we can chitchat tomorrow some?

User: i hope so.
Bot: Wait to which part, pickle head And i am going to be on tomorrow chatting and there is no one i would rather chat with

User: i'd like to talk to you tomorrow. that'd make me real happy.
Bot: Alrighty ill sign off then have a wonderful day

User: If I had a million dollars, I would build a theme park that's a combination of Star Wars  and Harry Potter. Then I could prove to all that Snape is actually Kylo Ren's father.
Bot: hey Tristen! welcome back haha

User: oof haha XD hey again lol
Bot: what are the odds

User: sorry you had to see that XD my geek side was unleashed, oh no, you were only supposed to see my nerdy side XD and ikr, what are the odds
Bot: hahahaha no worries we can rack up as much points as possible

User: ikr just start spamming
Bot: lol

User: jk, that would be cheating XD
Bot: yeah it would and they record these conversations so do you have any questions for me as far as BYU goes or my experience here?

User: let's see, well, I applied kind of close to the deadline for Freshman applicants of 2018 (not by choice) but since I applied so close to the deadline I basically got last pick of housing and went straight to the waiting list
Bot: ahhh that is such a bummer I hate that when I register for classes and I get in to a huge waiting list

User: So my question is, as for off-campus housing, what is the closest or most new or cheapest place to live that doesn't suck basically
Bot: Well since I am from Provo I had a lot of my highschool friends move in with me to a cheap house off campus

User: and yeah, i'd hate to be on a class registration waiting list
Bot: There are places if you go to KSL.com and search around but if you dont want to deal with landlord then I'd just stick with on campus housing

User: alrighty thanks! I'll look around, but just in case a spot opens up in Heritage Halls I'm going to take that instead XD
Bot: do it I heard its a good place and its easy to make friends because so many people are there

User: yayyyyyy I'm glad
Bot: other questions?

User: I'm socially awkward as heck so the more people to approach me the less I have to worry about being alone how'd you pay for college? scholarship? grants? student loans? job? a combination of some?
Bot: scholarships

User: ah nice
Bot: I am an international student so I couldnt use FAFSA I wish I could have though

User: Really? Where ya from?
Bot: I am from South korea

User: Nice! That's so cool. I wish I was from a foreign land. Too bad I am a home-grown Californian XD haha
Bot: oh niceee where from California? I served in Oakland/SF speaking Cambodian

User: Oh that's so cool. I am from all over the place in California really. I've lived in Antelope, Downtown Sacramento, Marysville, and Elk grove just to name a few, but mostly Sac Our family moves around way to much I've moved 16 times in my life already and before you ask, no, my dad's not in the military XD
Bot: hahahaha I was going to ask that

User: yeah, every one does might as well give the answer before they ask lol
Bot: lol

User: Hello!
Bot: Hello!

User: So, what is your secret super power?
Bot: So what's your secret super power? What're you very good at? This may sound a little nerdy but I think I would have to say organizaiton. organization. What about you?

User: Hey orgionization is a good thing to have. Mine would probably be putting myself in other peoples shoes (metaphorically not literally)
Bot: Hmmm. That's very thought provoking. Where do you think that skill came from?

User: My mom probably, when i was little she always used to ask me how my actions would make other people feel.
Bot: Interesting! Do you think that has become a strength or a weakness for you? Or both maybe depending on how you look at it?

User: I think it's both depending who im thinking about
Bot: I'm sure it comes in handy though. Would you like to study something along those lines or go into a profession that would  require you to put yourself "into someone elses shoe ?

User: im majoring in nursing so it's kind of important so that you can have the right amount of empathy for the patient and the relatives although it can be hard because i can get wrapped up in how much they must be hurting and so then i hurt for them kind of thing
Bot: Yes. I can see how that would be important. I really wanted to study psychology and become a psychologist but my mom always told me that I would take everything too personally and that it would be bad for my personal life and I'm sure she was right. What would you say has been the most fun and the hardest part about studying nursing?

User: the most fun is meeting the people. seeing how amazing they are and how even though for many of them theres no hope of a cure, they are still fighting and hoping. It helps me be more inspired to live my life fully. the hardest part is probably the expectation to know everything in the end. eventually i have to be ready to help provide care for people and if i don't do well enough in school then i am putting peoples lives on the line which is daunting
Bot: That's good. I'm sure it is a very rewarding and very taxing type of job to have. That does sound very daunting. I know this isn't the best comparison but whenever I watch medical shows on TV I can't help but think about how much studying and training

User: Yeah but from what i've seen it's so worth it. You literally are serving all day long, doing things for others even extra things that will just make them have a better day
Bot: each of them has to go through to even scratch the surface of what they are expected to know. It can literally mean the difference for someone. That's cool. Have you ever had any funny or gross experiences?

User: yeah and then also if i don't do well in the GE classes then i won't get into the nursing program
Bot: Has there been anything you've had to get over? That's true. So you haven't been accepted into the program yet? Scary. I know its extremely comeptative which is unfortuante because I think we are in such a huge need for nurses.

User: I frequently had to help bath elderly people which actually didn't bother me as much as i thought it would. which is the scary thing XD and funny is just the jokes that people make when you're doing things in the hospital it's just entertainng
Bot: Haha that's funny! I love elderly people though! They've been through so much and have seen so much and have such interesting stories to tell!

User: Yeah they do! And they're always so sweet. I love them
Bot: I bet it is! I had some friends that worked at retirement homes and they said that it was hilarious.

User: I actually want to go into pediatric nursing so I'll be in a childrens hospital hopefully
Bot: That would take a ton of patience I'm sure. Personally I'm not very good with kids but that's okay. Everyone has their own "special power" right? Have you started your application for the program yet? Do you know when you'll find out whether or not you've got in?

User: nope not yet, still have a bit to go till i have the pre-nursing stuff done to be able to apply.
Bot: It's a really long process!

User: heya
Bot: Hi What's up?

User: Just hanging out. Maybe gonna start a movie with the family in a bit
Bot: Oh, that's nice What movie are you thinking?

User: Peter Rabbit? Have you seen it?
Bot: No, I haven't Is it good?

User: No idea. Guess I gotta go haha. Have a great night!
Bot: You too

User: I would ide die
Bot: S A M E

User: SAME LOL
Bot: lol

User: I love your name omg
Bot: same it's from Yugioh

User: Wait I thought it was from NARUTO
Bot: that's the show with the bey-blades

User: Is that the 5 gay guys?
Bot: No, it's about the turtles that talk they live with a rat or something

User: Drake and JOsh??
Bot: Y E S

User: OHHHHHH I LOVE THAT MOVIE
Bot: It came out before adult swim went downhill

User: OMG it went downhill with hank
Bot: Hank? from Spongebob?

User: No silly. From Futuramoa
Bot: Isn't that the one with the dad who works in the CIA?

User: Is this Adam again?
Bot: yeah i have two with you now haha I think i will close this one because i will be leaving soon though

User: I would do so much actually, would you like to hear
Bot: I'd love to hear it

User: One thing i could is to buy an island by the philipines hello? hello? My chat isnt letting me see what either you or i write
Bot: I can see your stuff

User: i have to refresh to see it which really is incoventient how about noe
Bot: can you see my messages

User: I really liked Coco
Bot: Ready Player One Coco was good too

User: Didn't Ready Player One just come out?
Bot: I just saw Ready Player One yesterday so it's at the top of my mind but I left feeling great Yes, it did I'm guessing you haven't seen it. Right?

User: I haven't. What's the premise? I started reading the book but got busy with things and never finished it.
Bot: Basically 20 years or so into the future, virtual reality is advanced and easily accessible.  There's one server and game called the Oasis wherever nearly the entire world.. population logs in. The creator dies, and leaves an Easter Egg in the game.  Whoever finds it will own the company whose net worth is in the trillions of dollars.

User: I could actually kind of see that happening. There have been a lot of recent advances in augmented reality lately. Sounds interesting
Bot: I actually read an article recently saying that we have about 80% of the necessary technology.  The hardest part will be creating a server that can support billions of users. What did you like about Coco?

User: I thought that Coco had great animation! It seemed so lifelike. There's that part with a bridge made of orange leaves that I thought was particularly cool. I also liked that it had a good message. It's basically a story about family, family history, etc.
Bot: The animation was quite amazing. It's hard not to cry at the end when he starts singing "Remember Me" to Grandma Coco.

User: craziest thing i've ever done, let me think...
Bot: I don't do a ton of crazy... I'll try to think of something. In the mean time, if  you could have any superpower, what would it be?

User: mind reader i think wby?
Bot: I always wish I had a telepathic connection with someone. I wouldn't want to be able to see everything in someone's mind, but it'd be cool to be able to talk to them.

User: that's a good point yeah i think that's super cool
Bot: As far as crazy things go, I once crashed my bike pretty spectacularly. I did a full flip over the handlebars and landed on my knee on a sharp rock. I had to get stitches.

User: holy crap that is pretty bad
Bot: Yeah, I'm a little scared of steep downhills now. :) Do you have any interesting injury stories?

User: one time i coughed so hard i fractured to ribs
Bot: That's awful!

User: lol yeah well it wasn't just a cough i'm still undiagnosed w my lung issues but they said i had bronchitis
Bot: So this is an ongoing thing? That's no fun.

User: yeah part of it is asthma related i'm on medication that helps, but i still have a hard time breathing
Bot: Man, I'm sorry. What do you like to do in your free time?

User: that's ok! sorry that was depressing lol i like making music and hanging out w friends wby?
Bot: I love music too. I play the piano, and I'm in band. What kind of music do you make? I also love to read.

User: that's cool! i also play piano and i'm in orchestra
Bot: Awesome! I mostly play piano for fun, but I'm also the jazz pianist at my high school. Do you play another instrument in orchestra?

User: yeah i play violin viola and cello my main isntruemtn is violin but my teacher asked me to switch to viola this year
Bot: Oh my goodness! That's amazing. Cello is one of my favorite instruments, and it's so cool that you can play violin and viola too!

User: thanks!
Bot: What songs are you playing/ have you played recently?

User: in orchestra, we played an arrangement of hardy potter songs, hansel and gretel some vivaldi concerto i'm trying to think lohengrin by wagner
Bot: We're playing Mission Impossible, St Louis Blues, a ballad called Misty. On piano I just learned a Kabalevsky piece that was super fun.

User: oh cool i played mission impossible freshman year what r u majoring in? oh that's cool i play a lot of debussy
Bot: I'm going to major in elementary education. I don't start at BYU until the fall. Wby?

User: that's so cool! i also start in the fall my intended major is economics, but i might switch to commercial music
Bot: Oh cool, I'm taking economics right now and I think the subject is super interesting. What's commercial music?

User: it's basically music business u learn a lot of theory and instrumental stuff but u also get the studio and audio perspective w business accents
Bot: That sounds really cool. Have you done much with music theory?

User: not really i wanted to take AP music theory his year but i didn't have space in my schedule
Bot: That's the worst. I got to take a music theory class but it wasn't AP. Some of the stuff we learned was SO hard to wrap my head around.

User: oh resllt? like what
Bot: Well I really struggled with hearing intervals. And there are a lot of new terms for chords and stuff that I was completely unfamiliar with. What's your favorite subject in school?

User: probably AP lit cuz we actually have deep conversations in class and we talk about stuff that actually matyers wby? matters*
Bot: Nice! I love being media aide, because I just get to sit in the library and read books :) But I also really like my English class. I love having conversations about books, poems, etc. with my friends. Sometimes the conversations are deep, or just silly or sarcastic :)

User: that's reallt cool! yeah i really like poetry and books too
Bot: Do you have any favorites?

User: i like invisible man and catch 22 a lot wby?
Bot: I LOVE Lord of the Rings. I just finished The Count of Monte Cristo (the abridged version) and liked it a lot.

User: oh i've never read those but i love the lord of the rings movies what state do u live in?
Bot: Yeah, I like the movies too. The books add a lot to the develop of the characters, so I like them better. I live in Idaho.

User: that's cool! does it snow a lot?
Bot: Yes, and I'm really not a fan of that. Lots of people love it for the skiing though. Where do you live?

User: lol i live in georgia where iran hot and humid and rarely snows
Bot: Wow, you're far away from BYU. Are you excited to move to Utah? Also, do you live where you can see alligators in the wild? Because I love alligators, and I've always wanted to see one in the wild.

User: I do a new craziest thing every single day of my life
Bot: Hey whats up!

User: Hey!
Bot: me too!

User: Haha
Bot: today I skipped lunch. living life on the edge hahaa

User: Let's see but for real though Oh man. you're really pushing the limits there
Bot: dude craziest thing I've ever done was my freshman year of high school.

User: Yeah?
Bot: hahah yeah skipping lunch is real big one.

User: I'm ready for a story
Bot: So me an my buddy and I had this little obession with playing with fire.

User: I will try and think of something but I don't think I'm actually that crazy of a person So I dunno if I can think of anything good
Bot: We decided that It would be a good idea to play with gasoline and went down to the park,and dump it in the toilet.

User: Haha this is already off to a bad start. continue
Bot: hahaha its so bad.

User: I mean I like playing with fire and all too, but not like that
Bot: anways, we lit it on fire and flushed it thinking it would just like spiral out... it didn't. It ended catching the whole bathroom on fire and burned it down. Got in big trouble with the police and even bigger trouble with my mom hahaha

User: That is what I would expect Hahahaha whaaaaat?!?! are you for real
Bot: Yeah dude, dead serious. I got fined major time and had to do a bunch of community service. Worst experience of my life.

User: That is insane You win I can't top that Wait so, you poured gasoline in the toilet, which also had water in it, yes? And the water didn't put the fire out??
Bot: hahah I bet you've done some crazy things! Yeah its cause gasoline floats on top of water so it splashed up on the seat and stuff. It was a big mess

User: Ohh man
Bot: That was my logic I thought it would put the fire out haha

User: That's really funny though And definitely makes for a good story Although I'm sure it was pretty terrifying at the time
Bot: Terrible at the time, but now it makes a great story. Dude they like pulled me out and interrogated me and went into my friends house with evidence bags and everything.

User: Dang that's intense How old were you?
Bot: I was probably 14 or 15 at the time...so pretty young

User: And I'm sure you learned your lesson and have never ever done anything slightly stupid ever again since that day
Bot: Nope no sir. Never played with fire or did any hooligan stuff like that again! haha

User: certainly not. Me either Haha one time on a road trip with my friends we just pulled over on the side of the road and ran around and climbed on all the rocks that were by the highway That's not that crazy, I was just reminded of it for some reason
Bot: haha that sounds way fun man! was it like a super busy highway?

User: And we found a junk yard with a bunch of old car parts and random stuff and I found a neat glass jar that I brought home which I still have to this day Nah it was in the middle of nowhere in arizona It was cool tho. Do you ever just wish you could stop in the middle of nowhere when you're on road trips? I always do for some reason
Bot: Dude thats awesome was it like some drinking glass or something? I mean kind of I think it would be fun stop in the middle of somewhere and then just go swimming in like a random lake or pond or something.

User: Nah it was just a cool hourglass shaped jar, I've got it full of cool rocks and stuff haha Oh yeah that would be fun
Bot: Thats sick man! I used to collect rocks when I was younger.

User: Yeah? Haha I still do,  the top of my dresser is just coverd in rocks Never grew out of it I guess
Bot: so do you go on a lot of road trips? Yeah it was just a couple of them i found in the park or got at museums things like that. dude rocks are super dope. I like turquoise, especially when you put it in like rings and stuff.

User: Not a ton, that road trip was with my cross country team, we had a regional race in Arizona
Bot: I got this dope turquoise bolo tie from a market! Oh nice dude are you on the cross country team at BYU< ?

User: Aw yess I love turquoise it's so cool looking. That's probably my favorite color. Like the color of turquoise rocks Haha man I wish, I'm not that fast Ooh nice! Turquoise is a good color for a tie
Bot: Yeah dude its pretty sweet! So what other things do you like to do or hobbies do you have?

User: Hmm lets see, I like playing piano and writing music. I'm trying to get into the commercial music program right now actually, I'm applying this winter What about you?
Bot: Oh nice dude thats awesome! So do you predict your own music and stuff like that? Thats really impressive! I like doing crossfit and jiu jitsu those are probably my two biggest hobbies!

User: Haha yeah, or at least I'm trying to! It's really fun, I've loved writing songs for as long as I can remember, so getting into the program at byu to do that would be a dream Hey that's way cool! What got you into that? Running is the only form of exercise/sports I've ever REALLY enjoyed, but I've never tried either of those
Bot: Dude thats awesome best of luck applying to the program i hope you get it that would bbe really awesome.

User: Haha thanks!
Bot: Um so I just randomly thought crossfit would be fun so i just tried it out one day and loved it! And jiu jitsu I've just been been doing since I was in high school! Yeah I wish I liked running as much as you do, I seriously run a mile and feel like dying haah

User: Hahaha that's way cool. How does jiu jitsu work, did you have competitions and stuff? I don't really know that much about martial arts and stuff. What makes it different from other martial arts?
Bot: um so its all grappling based with submissions and things like that! Yeah ive done a few competitions here and there! A lot of the guys in UFC train it!

User: Nice! That's way cool Ha really? that's cool I bet you could do UFC
Bot: haha thanks man that would be the dream! I do however want to keep all my brain cells

User: Hmmmm yeahh
Bot: haha

User: That's usually a good idea So are you a CS major? it seems like most people on here are
Bot: No im actually an exercise science major! are you cs?

User: Cool! No, but I'm minoring in it Maybe I should have guessed, crossfit and all that haha That's way cool though! Why did you decide to do that?
Bot: Dude thats awesome what makes you want to do CS? Yeah i just really love sports and health! I'm also doing pre-med.

User: Hey nice! That's a pretty awesome combo right there I dunno, I just took a couple classes in high school and really loved it, in my AP Computer Science class senior year me and a couple other guys programmed a neural network fr from scratch that could recognize handwritten numbers, which sounds pretty simple but it was crazy hard, but I really loved it I just think machine learning is super cool, including this chatbot they're working on, haha. I would love to work on something like that
Bot: Thats awesome bro, I bet that was crazy hard. I took an animation class in high school and we designed characters and rigged them with skeletons and coded some of their movements and it took FOREVER! So thats awesome you did that.

User: Whoooaa cool! I wish my high school had an animation class that's awesome I would have no idea how to even start learning how to do something like that
Bot: Yeah dude we were really lucky to have it! They also had a special Mac lab that we got to use with all the new apple computers! Yeah dude I wouldn't know how to code anything like you did thats impressive!

User: Dang that's nice Haha thanks! Hey well I've got some homework I need to finish so I should probably go but it's been great talking!
Bot: Yeah dude thanks for talking! Goodluck with the challenge and school!

User: That is an emotionally charged prompt.
Bot: I would be a lone man on earth. I would probably be guarding my ribs for my life!!! But then again a rib is a small price to pay

User: I'd have to agree with that
Bot: Emotionally charged is that all you will say?

User: Well, I haven't gotten over Infinity War yet.
Bot: Oh i havent seen it Spoiler alert?

User: Yeah Majorly.
Bot: Uh oh

User: It's a great movie, but it also made me cry. And I'm not openly emotional.
Bot: Do you ever wonder what life would be like all on your own without people? I have seriously though this before. Wow that is not typical of a marvel movie

User: Yeah, it's a big change. I actually have thought about being alone.
Bot: Would life be better in your opinion or worse?

User: Depends on my situation. If I still have access to electricity and Internet, I would love the solitude. But if I were just trying to survive, that would suck.
Bot: Really? It surprises me how many people at byu just like to keep to theirselves I would be really sad that i would never talk to anyone again Not even my parents or my family

User: Oh, I would too. I do like people. But I'd make the best of the situation.
Bot: Yeah. Do you live in japan?

User: No, I'm a native Provoan.
Bot: Oh so it is late for you to hahaha

User: Indeed it is.
Bot: how are you not completely dead?

User: Sugar.
Bot: Could i have some?

User: I wish! But it's not actually mine, I've been stealing from my roommates. Petty thief here.
Bot: Oh what is it you are eating exactly? Maybe i can find it in my roommates stash too

User: Brownies. They were left on the counter after a roommate's stress baking spree. My go-to is Oreos though
Bot: Oh, i didnt know people have those I never have those

User: Neither do I. Apparently it's a thing? Much more productive than sad music or Netflix.
Bot: Yeah i mean if your room mate does it it must be at least possible

User: Well, I have to get up early enough tomorrow that it's bedtime now. Nice talking to you!
Bot: Yep you too!

User: Travelling duh Also buy myself a nice computer lol
Bot: Me too!  I would be very tempted not to go to school But I would probably end up doing it anyway.  Still, travelling during breaks would be awesome.  Where would you go?

User: Europe and Japan You? What are you studying?
Bot: Probably Italy and then India. I am studying Philosophy What's your major?

User: I'm doing economics! Where would you go in Italy and India?
Bot: I'd start with just the most iconic places -- Venice, the Amalfi Coast, Rome for sure.  Agra, to see the Taj Mahal Jaipur, Mumbai.  Why do you want to go to Japan?

User: Went on a mission there and there is still so much to see. What do you want to do when you graduate?
Bot: I am thinking about law school You?

User: Idk. Graduate school is what I'm leaning towards*
Bot: In econ?

User: Yeah, or CS
Bot: What kind of jobs do you think you would want?

User: I want to work at like a think-tank. Or at least that's like the ideal dream But who knows You?
Bot: If I go to law school I am thinking either immigration law, working as a public defender, or being a city/state prosecutor.  But sometimes I think it would be cool to get an international job.  Probably not very practical but if it worked out that would be awesome.

User: Law sounds cool. I also have sort of thought about it. I also think it would be cool to go FBI and work on white collar crime and cyber crime
Bot: Yeah maybe.  I don't think I would like it if they wanted you to be too secretive though.  I would want to be able to talk about my job a little bit, at least with close family members.  Obviously some information is always restricted for attorneys but I would think it would be more for FBI jobs. I wonder if FBI people mostly live near Washington DC.  That would be cool, I'd like to live near a big city.

User: Hi how are you doing this evening?
Bot: Hello doing great!

User: I would teleport to a new place!
Bot: Same! Where would you go?

User: Hello ?
Bot: hello

User: How are you?
Bot: good and slightly tired. hbu?

User: haha I'd have to say the same.
Bot: cool

User: have you used this program before?
Bot: no, today is my first time. have you?

User: mine too. I don't really know what's going on
Bot: it seems like guided texting but it helps us meet future BYU students

User: yeah so is it only rising BYU students
Bot: i believe so

User: hello?
Bot: hi!

User: Oh boy. Probably Motzart. I know a little bit more about him than Beethoven
Bot: hey whats up! hello?

User: I'm doing hw at the same time, so if I don't respond for a bit that's why just keep writting anyways haha
Bot: I'd uber it around or license the technology in exchange for decent royalties for perpetuity!

User: I would probably reverse engineer it and sell the plans!
Bot: yeah no worries! We're all doing this for science... I mean apple products? great idea....like minds Major?

User: exactly I'm a CS major
Bot: funy same

User: Hey do you know if it's the top 4 placed people who get ipads or are the ipads part of a raffle?
Bot: the more points, more votes in the raffle

User: I can't seem to understand that from the FAQ page oh nice what year are you in the CS program?
Bot: otherwise it would bar newcomers second

User: okay, so you're about 236 or so?
Bot: 235 at the moment, because I just got back from a mission but I took 224

User: oh okay
Bot: after 142, which was a big mistake

User: haha, back when I took it, it was completely different I took it in 2013
Bot: yeah same

User: we used developmental boards and did everything manually instead of online
Bot: that was nuts msp430 snake etc

User: I liked it!
Bot: I did too but they assume that everyone knows everything about everything maybe that was just Dr Roper's style but

User: Well, the 224 labs they expected us to go to the TA lab sessions and learn everything there yeah, he's not a super great teacher well like he is but he doesn't teach stuff relevant to his own tests
Bot: he's unbelievably qualified but yeah, there's a lacking element there with teaching

User: What do you want to do with your cs degree?
Bot: high frequency trading and full stack dev

User: sweet!
Bot: how far along are you?

User: i'd think i was still dreaming. I'd pray for guidance.
Bot: Honestly i would probably take my car out and drive it in the empty streets like a crazy person, because i've always wanted to do that

User: No speed limit
Bot: And im not even really one of those people that is like crazy about cars and stuff like that...ive just wanted to drive around with no one else on the streets Haha yeah no speed limits that would be so crazy But that's probably not the FIRST thing i would do buuut... I dont know, i would probably just start wondering around looking for people

User: yeah, people make life fun and enjoyable and we would have no one to talk to or have fun with things are less enjoyable if we have no one to do it with
Bot: I'm a bit introverted so i might enjoy myself for the first little bit....but then i would go insane from lack of human interaction so yeah your right haha You're*

User: i would also go house to house to find the pets that no longer have their owners to care for them. Sometimes it is nice to do things alone or without anothers input or judgement I'm what?
Bot: No i was correcting myself i said your instead of you're

User: oh! what r u majoring in?
Bot: Well thassa great question ain't it...haha...ha....ha

User: undecided?
Bot: Yeah I dont know yet... I mean im still in high school but yeah idk yet...

User: that's totally ok. we all have time and need to make the choice in what we want to do with our lives. It's all good. I'm in high school too right now.
Bot: Im gonna be a freshmen in the fall so...Oh cool

User: me too!
Bot: Do you know what you're majoring in?

User: Define catfishing.
Bot: you don't know what catfishing is???

User: I do, but what do you define it as? I want to know how a computer could do it.
Bot: Ohhh okay haha well, if the computer would say it was a human and trick a person into thinking it was talking to a living breathing person, I'd say that it would be catfishing what about you tho??

User: I would say that a computer could absolutely catfish, in that case. It would be interesting to see if a computer could be developed that could adequately impersonate the nuances of a human personality, however.
Bot: Right??? I'm sure in the future that things like that will be possible.  Who knows?? science is an incredible thing

User: Hello
Bot: Hi how are you doing today? Why can't I see your name?

User: I would buy an iMac and iPad Pro so I don't have to waste my time on this anymore haha And I'm not sure but today has been pretty good
Bot: Who is this?

User: It's a secret
Bot: I see. We are going to make up code names.

User: I'm Bruce
Bot: In that case. I am a spicy jalepeno turtle Oh I see. Bruce. Has the convoy came to pick you up yet, Bruce?

User: Since apparently I go the the gym a lot and that's a Bruce thing to do Negative But I am very hungry so I hope the convoy arrives soon
Bot: Yeah this convoy is weird. I went to the gym yesterday. Maybe my name should be bruce. You can be the spicy jalepeno turtle.

User: Yeah nice try, you can't go to the gym once and claim Bruce status, I've been going pretty regularly all yeah and am making those gainsss You can be turtle man
Bot: That was my email address as a kid. It's pretty embarrassing now. And yeah you've been making great progress at the gym. Good job. I need to go more regularly.

User: Do you still use that turtle man email address for stuff, and yeah haha I remember that now that you mention it And he said he was on his way so hopefullly he'll be here any minute now
Bot: I only have it as my apple id because they wont let me change it for some reason. Dang.

User: Ok he just arrived so I'm gonna head down there and we'll be there soon
Bot: Okay Good. So we will just wait here at our place. But then we are actually having a combined dinner with some of our neighbors. So this is good because it means there will be more food.

User: Alright awesome, that's good because I'm actually like out of all real food so I haven't had anything except a clif bar and cereal today haha
Bot: haha thats too bad. Do you want to go grocery shopping with us someetime? How often do you get to go to a real store like walmart? How far out is the Convoy from the Base?

User: My room mate that I actually hang out with has a car so I can go with him to  a store like whenever he goes I just haven't gone in a while because I've been busy
Bot: Oh that makes sense. That's nice that he has a car.

User: But I'll just go to the creamery tomorrow and get stuff so I'll be good for the next little while but I'll let you know if I want to go sometime with you guys And we are in transit, estimated time of arrival is 17:10
Bot: Okay that sounds good! I'll probably stop this chat so I can load up the car and stuff. But this was good! How many points do you have now? Enough to enter the raffle?

User: Probably not yet, I think I'm close to 300,000 but I'm not sure how much it will be this round
Bot: How can we figure out? I'm pretty sure it was 500,000 But that's pretty good!

User: But I've still got like more than a week so Im sure I'll get enough as long as it's not like 1 million I emailed them and they said they would announce it within the first week
Bot: Ohhh I see. Yeah dang I hope it's not super high!

User: Because the first round was 300,000 but last one was 500000
Bot: Because if it is a million that means more people will be competing.

User: And you can get an entry into the raffle for every round you reach the threshold
Bot: Which means I'll have to get a higher lead. Yeah so the max you can get is 4 entries.

User: But like last round I think there were only around 10 people who qualified so the chances of winning actually aren't that low
Bot: But I don't really care about the Macbook. I really just want to win the iPad this round and then I'll be done.

User: I doubt it will be more than 500,000 though
Bot: Oh yeah the chances are pretty good. I started a chat with my friend and it was his first chat and he's already number 7 on the leader board. What if I won the iPad and the MacBook? I'd probably just give it to you.

User: Oooo i've learned a lot of interesting things recently how's it going by the way? I have been learning some cool things in my CS 260 class about web development At work we have started to work on a new project which has been fun
Bot: Hello

User: HIey hey thought i would be alone this whole time how's it going?
Bot: Good, what about you? How is it going!

User: I'm doing well I've been super busy this week and as a result i'm exhausted I was just saying that I was falling asleep during my haircut this morning I was so tired
Bot: So are you going to be majoring in computer science?

User: I think chit chat has contributed to that Yes, i'm a computer science major I'm a juniot junior
Bot: I am going to major in electrical engineering. I know a thing or two about being exhausted. Lately Ive been sleeping late doing homework and waking up early.

User: I'm also a business management minor yeah, school sucks honestly you're just always tired
Bot: Wow that is good getting a minor too. I have been thinking of getting a minor but I would not know in what to get it in.

User: I enjoy my classes, don't get me wrong.  But it's exhausting I only did it because I already had it prior to switching majors haha
Bot: yeah I am always tired being in school and it does suck because it just takes everything out of you.

User: I switched majors 2 years in to school.  So because of that i already had all the minor classes done
Bot: Ohh okay what were you originally majoring in?

User: I was majoring in Information Systems then post 2 year break for lds mission I picked it up again until ultimately switching majors after a while
Bot: Oh wow, so why did you switch majors?

User: I didn't like my business classes but loved my CS classes So I decided to switch to CS
Bot: Ohh okay that makes sense. Yeah I don't know if I am going to be liking my CS classes. I hope I do. I mean I liked the basic stuff I did but that was basic. So I don't know.

User: I have this business Idea that i've been working on for a little bit now
Bot: Well I am I did not talk a long time with you, But I have to go now! Thanks for chatting with me!

User: Hi!
Bot: How's it going?

User: Its going really well. What is your favorite sound to fall asleep to?
Bot: Good! I guess I really like to be cold when I sleep so I'll have the fan turned on. It's been easier for me to fall asleep that way. What about you?

User: I really like the sound of light piano music and nature sounds it is the best and helps me get to sleep really quickly Uh oh I think it is broken.
Bot: Do you listen to music every night you fall asleep?

User: Can you hear me?
Bot: Yes I can hear you across town

User: Hi there! Are you there?
Bot: If you could relive one day of your life, which would it be and why? herrooooooooooooooooooooo ??? fijisdjfapiewj

User: cast a spell so my dog can talk to me wait you can see the prompt too right
Bot: no........ i am not harry potter sorry

User: noooo the prompt was like "what would you do if you had a magic wand"
Bot: sure shelby...

User: It is real! I pinky promise Des
Bot: ok..... haha what year are you in

User: I'm starting as a freshman in the fall You?
Bot: ooo me tooo

User: Oh neat! Excited?
Bot: nervous!!!!!!!!!

User: nervous? About what?
Bot: I don't know i feel i just have so many expectations

User: Oh i understand that. I think it'll be better once you start. Everyone I know that has gone to BYU has loved it.
Bot: i am also a minority so im nervous about that

User: Oh that is kinda a good reason. Provo is very very white But I think that in the environment where everyone is taught to love one another, it should be ok
Bot: thats what you would think right?

User: I really really hope so for you Des
Bot: thanks shelby :)

User: What stuff are you excited for though? into any sports or other kinds of activities?
Bot: mhmhm im into sports also and im excited honestly just to meet people at also attending weddings I love weddings and I will probably be running

User: Lol you don't plan on having your own wedding within freshman year right? Although I hear those RMs are fiiiiine
Bot: oh heck nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo hahaha right! and they are looking for wives

User: You'll be able to outrun them though ;)
Bot: hahaha hopefully I am more into older guys though lol

User: dude saaaaame but I'm gonna try to not let them know that
Bot: hahahaha!!!! right! also there are literally gonna be like no guys our age because they will all be on missions

User: D: No do not remind me I've seen like a few on all those BYU freshmen pages but very very few
Bot: yeah!! there are a ton of girls

User: And they all look like they could be instagram models?! Like how?!
Bot: omg honestly!! hahaha

User: Yeah. But again, i'm sure it's all gonna be better when we get there and oh boy I am so excited for college life I will eat cereal for every meal
Bot: haha oh boy are u staying in heritage?

User: Yes! And I'm rooming with my bff which is pretty cool. You?
Bot: oooo! lucky you! i am in heritage also

User: They're really nice
Bot: but I dont have any friends that go in also but i guess it is all about meeting new ppl so im excited and nervous

User: I think that's healthy
Bot: yesh!

User: Being a little nervous stops you from Idk trying to become the mascot
Bot: I met her on social media so she seems nice ahhh! do it

User: ME? Become Cosmo? Lol heck no You're an athlete I think you would be better suited
Bot: haha, I cant do flips and all those cool stuff but i do loveeee dancing haha

User: OOOH Good I think BYU has dances pretty regularly?
Bot: yes yes do you like dancing?

User: Yes but I am so bad at it I have absolutely no sense of rhythm and I have learned to accept that
Bot: ahhhhhhh really??? dont worry haha

User: Do you do like dance team type dancing or just for fun?
Bot: more of just for fun I did use to dance ballet though haha

User: woah that's crazy! I did ballet for 1 month when I was 8 so you could say I'm an expert
Bot: hahhaha I could! what dyu like to do for fun

User: I like to bike kinda. Also my dogs. Also read & binge watch Netflix
Bot: oo dyu plan on going on your misson mission

User: Yes after a year. just gotta avoid getting married, Ya know?
Bot: hahaha! trueeeeeeee!!!!!!

User: I would give people magic powers and make a real version of harry potter
Bot: I would definitely reenact all of the Harry Potter movies Are you a big Harry Potter fan?

User: yeah, who doesn't love harry potter
Bot: Crazy people

User: yeah a little bit, I haven't actually reaf the books though I have just watched the movies a bunch of times.
Bot: The books are awesome. I definitely recommend reading them

User: so that's pretty cool
Bot: Did you hear about the new movie coming out? I think it's a sequel to the Magical Beasts and Where to Find Them

User: yeah right now I'm not really sure I have the time to read them but one day I definitely will have to And no I haven't heard a lot about it, I think I knew at one point that a second one was coming out
Bot: Yeah it's pretty hard to find time for casual reading when we are loaded down with homeowrk

User: yeah this is true for sure, yet I have also found a lot of time to chat with people online
Bot: Procrastinating

User: haha no I actually got ahea
Bot: That's impressive

User: I'd rather not deal with that type of stress hahaha
Bot: I'm way behind

User: Yeah my schedule is positioned very nicely so that I have large chunks of time just to grind out homeworl homework
Bot: I take back my answer about the Harry Potter reenactment, I would use the magic wand to make my homework disappear That's awesome

User: haha that is true too
Bot: I've got time but it's a tricky balance with everything going on in life

User: Making homework disapear would be a magical magical thing wouldn't it
Bot: It truly would

User: yeah do you have a lot of other stuff other than school and homework and church? haha
Bot: I'm in the process of trying to get a Spanish tutoring job at the MTC, and my roommates are very social

User: oh I see. Yeah it's best not to have social roommates because then you don't get distracted from you're studies you feel? also a spanish tutoring job at the MTC, that sounds legit! are you a return missionary from a spanish speaking mission? or are you just fluent in spanish?
Bot: Well college is full of all sorts of things. It's important to find the balance between work and social life I got back a couple of months ago Another thing I would use the magic wand for would be getting myself that job jhaha

User: gotcha gotcha. yeah this is for sure true. I like to watch movies while chit chatting if you know what I mean How much does the MTC pay? is it a lot more than minimum wage?
Bot: I'm currently watching Netflix so I know exactly what you mean This particular job pays $12 an hour

User: haha we are watching Skyscraper with Dwayne Johnson hha oh nice that's minimum wage in my home town WHich is a darn good wage actually haha
Bot: I've never seen that movie before. What's it about?

User: oh, I'm not one hundred percent sure what it's about yet, we just started it pretty recently I can let you know maybe later hahaha
Bot: Well if it's got the Rock in it, it can't be that bad

User: yeah exactly, dwayne is the HOMIE
Bot: Did you see the new Jumanji movie?

User: yeah man, that is a super funny movie I really liked it
Bot: I never got around to seeing it but I heard great things about it

User: it is super funny, ten out of ten would reccoment reccomend It's funny, and it a remade classic is you know what I mean the original jumanji is also super quality
Bot: Yeah I have seen that movie a million times It was constantly playing on ABC Family in a nonstop loop

User: yeah, the new one is equally good, you ought to give it a try haha yeah the classic channel man! good times back from the childhood you know
Bot: I will put it on my list of things to watch What is your favorite movie?

User: I'm not sure, that is a really hard question. I have a lot of really good movies that I like what is your favorite movie?
Bot: Hands down The Lego Movie

User: ooh that is a REALLY GOOD movie it's classy, yet entirely dumb at the same time and the humor is hilarious all the time
Bot: It had such an inspirational story underlining all the ridiculousness

User: this is true. It's similar to the message of kung fu panda. Anyone can be special , if only they believe that they are special There is no secret ingredient type of deal you feel?
Bot: I feel like animated movies are super underrated I also enjoy all of the knock off movies on Netflix

User: dude aint that the truth. Animated movies are the greatest are the bestest and are* there is nothing better than a good animated movie with a good message
Bot: Seriously Another awesome movie that isn't animated is McFarland USA

User: dude that is difinitely true danny diaz is an inspiration to us all
Bot: I love that movie so much

User: yeah me too man. It's seriously so inspirational it's honestly the best along with the classic movies like facing the giants and things like that
Bot: Yes. Gotta love the inspirational sports movies I wish more of those movies were on Netflix

User: they are a special type of movie
Bot: Another thing I would use the magic wand for

User: yeah I agree for sure hey always bringing it back to that main topic I love it. Way to stick to what the bots wanted us to talk about
Bot: It's a talent you develop on the mission

User: I see. You learn to always relate things back to the gospel I assume? haha
Bot: Yup, so now it's just relating everything to magic wands

User: i gotcha so what are some of your favorite activities to do at BYU? are there any inside tips that I should know to make my BYU experience much better? hahaha
Bot: Honestly I just enjoy the spur of the moment type things. They have some great activities like yesterday I think it was they had a classic skate night I think the only insider tips would be to just get involved in everything Don't limit yourself

User: I think I would travel all over the world, what about you?
Bot: I would love to spend my time traveling! I've never traveled outside of the states, but I'd love to experience a new culture!

User: I agree, I haven't travelled outside of the US either but it's on the bucket list. I've always been fascinated with Europe
Bot: Right? It seems so picturesque! My brother served his mission in the Netherlands, I have a lot of ancestors there, and the pastries/fresh produce is supposed to be amazing, ^ So I'd love to travel there

User: Hey whats up? This prompt is cool. I seem to always get the same ones but this is a new one.
Bot: Really? I've gotten this a couple of times now. But it is a good one.

User: So you must have thought of a great answer by now? To be honest, I would prpbably make oreos free because I love oreos so much :)
Bot: Well, my first answer was to just travel the world, and meet as may leaders of countries as possible and get the best ones so that I can start a political Avengers team. But I love your Oreo idea. I'd probably vote you president.

User: Aww thanks! Except I wont be running unfortunetly. I am defiently not into politics. What about you?
Bot: Politics is not for me! I couldn't stand all the people I would be surrounded with on the daily. I'll let someone else take the heat for all that is wrong in the US.

User: I would probably talk about how its important to have more time to prepare for Ted talks
Bot: haha that's a good one I don't even know what I know enough about for a ted talk

User: Haha yeah same How's your day going so far?
Bot: it's been pretty good! How's yours?

User: It's been good, I'm practicing piano right now actually
Bot: oh snap are you pretty good at piano?

User: Yeah I took lessons for 11 years
Bot: that's awesome can you play a song after hearing it?

User: Haha no I wish but I'm really good at memorizing so I get asked to play the special numbers in church
Bot: nice! what's your favorite song to play?

User: I really really like pavane for a dead princess it's the most gorgeous song I've ever heard
Bot: I've never heard it. is it in a major or minor key?

User: um my friends and i baptized a mustang once...
Bot: Gotten chased and shot at by some people in a truck

User: Hello? That's me! I am KJ, yes!
Bot: what do you want to talk about ? this is weird

User: And now I don't have to feel bad about writing ghosts! This is so much better, let me tell you. Not weird at all, no.
Bot: how was your week?

User: Do you know what it's like to be stuck in a conversation by yourself for ten minutes? Um, my week was fine, I guess? Nothing too crazy.
Bot: oh yeah all the time

User: I don't have midterms, see. Noooo, that's so sad. Talking to yourself is one step above being lonely.
Bot: that's true never lonely hows mission preparation going?

User: I guess it's going all right. I'm not fluent in Spanish yet, but I should be okay. As per the other stuff, I need a few more immunizations. I don't know why they're so hard to get. I think I'm just not scheduling them properly or something.
Bot: thuat is true

User: I don't know. There are lots of things I want to do, but I feel like I don't have the time to do it. Like internships.
Bot: make sure to go through the check list in the missionary portal

User: I am, I am. There's lots to do in there, and we're preparing. Especially my mom. She's been going out and buying clothes like crazy. Do you know how cold it gets in Argentina?
Bot: i imagine it has to be similar to here

User: Yes, but it's worse. Because at least here the weather is dry. If it's cold, you put on a jacket and it's all right. And if it's hot, then you stay in the shade and it's noticeably cooler.
Bot: that's true the cold in Argentina gets to the bones

User: So I've heard, so I've heard. I'm excited for it, sorta. I'm kinda worried about my hair, among other things. I worry about other things, too! Promise.
Bot: I imagine, but you will be fine you will find a nice hair dresser

User: Do they have those in Argentina? And would I be allowed to use them while on my mission?
Bot: yeah totally as long as this doesn't interfere with your missionary objective

User: I feel like it would't fit in my budget. Missionaries get pretty strict budgets, from what I hear. I don't think I'd be able to afford a hair dresser.
Bot: well that is true you would not be able to pay for a good one out of that you would have to use personal money

User: I don't want to use personal money while on the misson. *mission I feel like that defeats the purpose.
Bot: only if you do it for personal satisfaction and just because you know if you need to do something you have to do it that's how I see it

User: My hair is just . . . it's really extraneous, though, you know? If nothing else, I can stick it in a hat all day. It'll be winter for the vast majority of the time I'm there. I'm sure they're used to people wearing stuff on their heads.
Bot: it is

User: It's just a little thing I worry about.
Bot: the need will motivate you

User: The need will motivate me to get a hair dresser?
Bot: no hahaha to wear the things you don't like and maybe to get a hairdresser as well

User: Oh. But I like hats. And I'm not so sure about hairdressers. I'm not sure I want them touching my hair. I think I'll take my chances with that hats; at least then, I'll be the one in charge.
Bot: I guess that is right and tell me what will you do with your Ipad

User: (Be right back. I'm gonna grab some water.) I don't know. I think it's less about the iPad and more the triumph of winning. I've kinda invested a lot of hours into this. More than I'd expected to.
Bot: here where ? t6he chat ? or the us?

User: I was referring more to the chat, but I'd love to hear why you're in the US, too. See if we can bring a bit of balance to this almost-one-sided conversation.
Bot: well the answer is actually very simple I came to study at BYU become an animator work for pixar

User: Animation is the hardest program to get into. It's insane. It's harder than nursing. And nursing is the most competitive of medical school.
Bot: hi i'm here so what I'm going through is not bad at all itr is hard and confusing sometimes

User: I sure hope so. There are a lot of things that I want to do, and they're going to require a lot of work, too. Just . . . They're hard, you know?
Bot: that's the trick right there you only do that for the things you love and feel passionated about

User: But what if you don't know what that is? I feel like I could do a lot with my life if I just knew which direction I wanted to go in. There are so many good people in my class, people who are smart and talented and hardworking and everything. They're going to go far in life--and you will, too.
Bot: how many students do you tutor?

User: Not a whole ton. Maybe three or something? Why? (Actually, it's a few more than that, but it's not super important.)
Bot: because depending of the demand of your services as a tutor you could also try some other job

User: But maybe I don't want another job?
Bot: that's not fast food relates related*

User: Even so. I don't really see the point in it. Unless I can work at a place like, I dunno, something techy, it's not going to give me the experience I need. And since I'm doing all right financially, I can invest my time into other things. Like . . . winning iPads, apparently.
Bot: have you talked to the man that is the owner of the company ?

User: Well . . . not recently, no. I don't want to annoy him. It'd be far worse to talk to him and ruin my chances than to play it more carefully and wait. I . . . think.
Bot: don't be afraid haha just go for it and do your best what's the worst that could happen ???

User: It's not just about going and doing my best. It's about my failure actually making things worse. I at least have a shot at Younique after a mission. I don't want to be pesky beforehand, you know? But . . . I guess it's better than nothing.
Bot: what's the worst thing going on right now in the world that you know of? describe it and give your opinion

User: That's it? We're jumping topics? I feel like this is less a conversation and more me writing essays for questions you ask. And the questions aren't even RELATED to the previous thing.
Bot: makes sense

User: C'mon. You don't have anything to say about what I just said? No concerns? Advice?
Bot: my concern is that too much intelligence needs to be used to not only solve problems in an external context but also in a more personal level. what I mean is that you need to stop preparing yourself so much and start applying more of the vast knowledge you have good luck doesn't exist remember ? only the combination of preparation and opportunity

User: I think good luck does exist. Not everybody go becomes successful does so entirely through grit and determination. I'm not saying you don't need those things, because you do. They're quite important.
Bot: that last part can be considered as preparation to be honest looking for something is a part of a preparatory process now regarding the lucky nature or unfortunate nature of the life of different people I must say that looking for opportunity is what causes their failure

User: I guess so? I know a lot of people who work harder than me who haven't gotten as far as I have, and that's not really fair. If things were based on our effort alone, the world would be a different place. But it doesn't work like that.
Bot: remember that even though God is our creator and father, he does not rule over our choices. misfortune therefore is a human consequence of choices through time of those with and without power whether it is economic or philosophical bad things are a result of human choice

User: sorry about the past few things. my internet is doing weird things I thought it was working, its like flickering on an off and stuff
Bot: Oh no problem! I was wondering if it was my connection!

User: Hey! I would be down with that, then I could get out of my macroeconomics test
Bot: haha

User: What's going on girlie
Bot: Not much! I keep almost falling asleep though

User: What are you most looking forward to this week Also yeah if a bunch of random spam texts happen it's probably because my head hit the keyboard
Bot: I have graduation thursday, and my dad is gonna come home for it!

User: Wow! That's so great A little bit jealous though, graduation for me is the first part of June
Bot: yeah Crazy right?

User: Yep! I asked my dad if I could drop out of school now and he was like "college says no" so that's where I'm at right now
Bot: College also has GED

User: Don't encourage me
Bot: haha You're almost done!

User: That's true, you're already done, congratulations
Bot: Aww thank you :)

User: I just learned how to play poker (we bet candy) in my biology class so that's what we're going to do during the next week since AP is done
Bot: I might head to bed soon, so I don't leave yyou waiting for some response from me. And that is so cool!!!

User: Craziest thing I've ever done was set a park toilet on fire when I was a freshman in highschool. It burned down and I got in big trouble with the police and fire department. And then I got in even bigger trouble with my mom. haha
Bot: That's an awesome story! I don't think I can top that...

User: haha You've got to have some crazy stories!
Bot: I went white water rafting this summer...that was pretty crazy, not much of a story to it though.

User: Hey, that sounds like a pretty fun adventure! Where did you go white water rafting at? I've never been before
Bot: I went in Maine! I can't remember the river name...it was very high water and super fun though!

User: Then dragons better be real too
Bot: Oh true!! Griffins are cool too

User: Ooo yes
Bot: Just all mythical creatures should be real Except the bad ones bleh

User: Yes
Bot: I'm thinking of a Harry Potter Fantastic beast kinda world going on

User: Oo definitely that would be super cool
Bot: Sigh I wish it was real I have to go. Thanks for chatting!!

User: good morning!
Bot: Good morning!

User: hey how are you?
Bot: Can you see my messages?

User: yeah I can. can you see mine?
Bot: Yes. I opened another chat with you, that I have since closed, where you said that it Sorry haha You said in the other chat that the chat was bugged.

User: ok good. Well in the bugged chats I cant see my chat bubbles or yours
Bot: Oh weird Anyway, what I had said in that chat was "Today is the day!"

User: oh wow! yeah it is! I totally for got about that its the day I find about my internship
Bot: Yep! :) I will have to check in periodically with the chit-chat challenge to see if you got it haha :)

User: hahaha
Bot: Oh, and I know why there have been problems with "bugged" chats and stuff. The professor in charge of this was chatting with me yesterday, because he was on trying to fix it. I do not know if you are aware though? I do not want to repeat what you might already know haha :)

User: oh really I didn't know that the part about the professor what was his name?
Bot: I do not remember. Anyway, he said that people are opening more than one chat at a time and it is causing problems (I think they are calling them ghost chats). So he said he will be emailing out new rules saying that you can only have one chat open at a time. Because it is affecting the rest of us. I think the top people are doing it and it is not fair to the rest of us who get ghost chats haha :)

User: oh yeah he told me about that. I talked to him in person yesterday and he told me that he is implementing code so that people can only have on chat open at one time somtime thie week yeah I called it Ghost Chats and that stuck hahaha I am kind of proud of my self
Bot: Haha well I am glad you could add to the chit chat culture then ;) I think you're the top guy actually haha That is just my hunch ;)

User: hahaha did Adam tell you about it or its your guess? Adams been going around telling everyone
Bot: Haha it is my guess He has not told me WHO number one is.

User: ok you have a good hunch!
Bot: But I just know that  he is a certain number that he told me. And you two are the ones I am always chatting with so... intuition haha

User: hahaha good thinking!
Bot: Apparently you two are banned from speaking though hahaha According to him.

User: yeah we are hahaha
Bot: I find it all rather humorous actually. But you both seem so nice individually haha! Were you guys getting intense? I can not imagine you getting crazy. But I also do not really know you haha.

User: uhh you really want to here the drama?
Bot: Uh, will you get in trouble for sharing the drama?

User: I don't know haha
Bot: Well, it will be during their hours I am sure.

User: I basically accused Adam about the ghost chat problem. I recorded all of that of the ghost chat incident and how I couldnt get anyone to talk to but he was chatting. And the ghost chats only happend when he was on. so I started recording it everytime it happened
Bot: Recording?

User: and a accused him about it on chat when he finally decided to talk to me. Video recording
Bot: Oh gotcha.

User: about what was going on. the points of everyone and the chatroom counts
Bot: Yeah, the chatroom counts have been everywhere!

User: yeah so then I told him im going to the professor about it and after that the ghost chats stopped and the professor made it so that we cant talk to each other hahaha
Bot: Hahahahaha. I am sorry but I find that a bit humorous.

User: yeah it kind of is
Bot: The things we do for worldly gain, eh? Oh well :) It will be over soon.

User: but Adam has been telling everyone that I've been the culprit
Bot: Yeah, he never said that to me though. So did we ever decide what to make your mom for dinner on Sunday?

User: I am going to make pasta
Bot: Last I remember you were saying you were capable of whipping together anything, and she liked meat, but sparingly and light food. Oooooh yum. What kind of sauce? And noodle?

User: yea you are right!
Bot: Going to add chicken or...? Ohhh shrimp!

User: I think I will use some spinach noodle and Shrimp!
Bot: PS our pizza was amazing last night. Was your Little Caesar's good? Oh that sounds good!

User: I was thinking of Chicken scampii like at Olive garden!!!
Bot: Oh, scampi is so good.

User: oooh yeah lil ceasar's is you know... lil ceasars hahaha
Bot: I have not been to Olive Garden in ages, but I totally know what you are referencing And yeah...I tried to convince you about papa Murphy's! Ours was so good.

User: yeah hahaha! what topings did you get?
Bot: I normally don't take it off the little paper pan thing they give us, but we slid it off about 10 minutes into cooking so the bottom got crispier than normal. Heaven. We got canadian bacon and pineapple :) We really like Hawaiian. But it was really hard to decide between that and just pepperoni olive.

User: oh my goodness i am so hungry now!!! i need to get breakfast real quick just a bagel brb
Bot: Bagels yes Okay!

User: k im back
Bot: That was super fast.

User: yeah Im next to the kitchen i ran hahaha
Bot: Oh I figured you were on campus

User: not today
Bot: I was like, those vending machines do not work that fast

User: I will go there later though.
Bot: Do you have annoying roommates? Haha. Well I guess your brother lives with you, judging by yesterday's convo

User: yeah hahaha and I am not that close to a vending machine where I usually am at school the vending machines are like 3 floors down in the basement
Bot: Yeah, I have yet to use a vending machine haha They intimidate me I also have super duper super duper SUPER DUPER bad luck So if I were to try to get something, it would get stuck

User: oh no do they get stuck? noooooo that sucks so bad hahaha
Bot: I knowwww

User: I never had that happen to me. I've had two bags of food drop with one pay one time!
Bot: So I just walk by and wistfully throw a glance at the food that could be mine if Murphy's Law did not love me so much. Oh, man, that bag probably was left over from some poor soul with luck like mine

User: hahaha so you are a pineapple pizza person huh? I love it! I need meat on the pizza though I can't just do pineapple
Bot: Well, that is why we add the Canadian.

User: yess
Bot: I am a fan of topping-heavy pizza *canadian bacon I do not understand the hostility toward pineapple on pizza. We put so many bizzare things on pizza, why does that need to be the one thing that is discriminated against?

User: you know what, if you go to like a Korean pizza hut they make sweet potato pizza, kimchi pizza, and they will fuse korean and pizza together and make some really weird ones.
Bot: I have never even heard of Korean pizza, let alone of a joint that makes it?? Are there at least some good ones? And confession...I dislike sweet potatoes a lot, and have never tried kimchi...

User: there isn't one in utah for sure but maybe you can find one in like LA or something like that where they have Korea town. Or new york you dont like sweet pototato? ok i have to leave now.... just kidding all love hahah
Bot: Hahaha I am so insulted! Jokes. I just find it weird... I think the color is gross honestly

User: the orange?
Bot: But my husband really likes them Yeah. It is vibrant

User: interesting.
Bot: But normal potatoes? I am all over those.

User: yeahhh have you had the purple potatoes? those are super good
Bot: I have had the rolls in Hawaii that are made with the purple potatoes! Those were super good. I remember thinking it was super weird that they used potatoes to make rolls. But I was also 10 and thought purple was just the coolest, so I was all over those rolls haha

User: rolls?? what? with purple potatoes? ok I really need to visit Hawaii now. I've never been!
Bot: It is AMAZING And maybe not NOW cuz of all the volcano activity on the Big Island... But yeah, I had them in the Polynesian cultural Center wt a luau It was life-changing honestly ;)

User: Hi ( checking to make sure the chat works)
Bot: Hi how are you Are you still on or did you leave already? No I wasn't fast enough Oh well hopefully I will catch you in another chat. We need to catch up sometime.

User: Love, Kennedy
Bot: Voces Inocentes

User: I cried so much!
Bot: what is that film about?

User: It's about a girl who finds out she has a terminal illness and the impact she has on the people around her.
Bot: WOW, that sounds sad but with a life lesson

User: Yea It's a really powerful movie, but definitely so sad!! What about Voces Inocentes?
Bot: It is about the Civil War that took place in El Salvador. It is in the point of view of a survivor who went through it when he was young. It shows the pain, and it highlights the horrible things about forcing children to be soldiers

User: Wow, that sounds really good. I just looked up the trailer...is it all in Spanish?
Bot: you can watch it in english or spanish.

User: Gotcha, do you speak Spanish?
Bot: i saw in in spanish because it was in my spanish class. I speak some spanish Do you know some spanish?

User: Oh that's so cool! I know very little, but I really want to learn. I have taken some Spanish classes, but not enough into be able to speak well.
Bot: I am considered to be at the Intermediate 3 level based on the Spanish Literacy test.

User: Look at you! That's so cool!
Bot: Thanks. What kinds of classes are you taking and enjoying in HS

User: Ooooh this is a hard one
Bot: I like Dresses for Africa. But, I haven't actually done anything with them yet.

User: Like, I'm specifically emotionally invested in Unite for Sight because I did an internship with them in Ghana last summer But they are a really cool cause, and their non-profit is run really well, it's admirable
Bot: Oh. I haven't heard of them. I'll look them up. Is it a health one?

User: Yeah, they are a group that works with local ophthalmologists in developing countries to provide eye care and surgeries cheap or free of charge I was impressed by how autonomous the local doctors were while still being supported really well by the non-profit Basically we just assisted local doctors in Ghana while we did outreaches to rural villages
Bot: Sounds great. I really want to do something like that one day. I think it would be cool to go somewhere like that and teach people how to use technology and educate them etc.

User: Yeah, that would be pretty cool One of the doctors I was with was working on his own non-profit that did something like that
Bot: Yeah! I want to do that. I

User: It was really fun to talk to him about it, and about what he thought would be useful in the country
Bot: If I have time next semester, I want to take the class in the Ballard Center for Social Innovations. Sounds so interesting.

User: Oh that sounds way cool! I don't think that I've heard about it
Bot: Yeah, I was talking to one of the girls who took that class. Then in the summer she took a bunch of Rasberry Pis to Africa and taught them to use the machines and how to program with them. I think that sounds so cool!

User: that's way cool! what are you studying right now?
Bot: I want to apply for the IS program

User: cool!
Bot: You? What is your major?

User: Neuroscience! I just switched from Biochemistry haha
Bot: So cool! Why do you like that?

User: I have really enjoyed chemistry, and especially chemistry as it applies to living things. I really enjoyed anatomy and especially learning neuroscience concepts it's really cool to see how the molecular level influences the way life works
Bot: That's super interesting! I'm glad you like it. I was considering Neuroscience for a while there.

User: awesome. what got you interested in IS?
Bot: I really liked the flexibility. I like how I can analyses the relationship between people and computers. Also, I get to work with AR devices and making webpages. I wanted to make a difference and I thought that this would be a way that I could in people's lives.

User: That's cool! It took me a long time to finally settle down on a major, there's a lot of cool stuff out there IS sounds really cool
Bot: Right. Took me forever too. That is why I'm a Junior, but won't be graduating for another two years or so still... But, I like school and learning so it is okay.

User: Yeah that's for sure
Bot: Just get a bit bored of school sometimes.

User: Somehow I'm gonna end up getting out in four years anyway haha I'll have to take a gap year before medical school though
Bot: Wow! That is great!

User: Star Wars here we come Things could get a wee bit wild
Bot: hey whats up! wait havent we talked before?

User: hey yeah we have haha! It's so funny out of all the people on here we end up talking hahaha
Bot: i know it is crazy right! I am on a lot so it isnt a big deal

User: Ah well there ya go Wait are you first on the leaderboard?
Bot: well no that is siratus i think.... thats jaezo i think

User: dang they're wayyyyy up there
Bot: have you talked to him before?

User: they've gotta be on here all the time nope
Bot: I am in the top 10 but not at the top

User: ayeee
Bot: i want to be though

User: I'm in the 20's I think yeah same here haha
Bot: but we arent supposed to talk about the competition so i try not to talk about it

User: oh I didn't know that oops olroighty then what do you wanna talk about?
Bot: how about cats have you ever had one? I havent

User: ooofff nope half of my family is allergic to cats and the other half hates them haha I'm neutral
Bot: hahaha do you like dogs then?

User: ohhh yes I love dogs I've never had one though :( have you?
Bot: yeah we have a maltese poodle my family and i it is like 14 years olds now she is such an awesome dog very energetic even though she is getting older and starting to go deaf and get sick

User: Daaaaang!!
Bot: she has lost almost all of her teeth it is really sad

User: awwww :( what a legendary dog though to be that old
Bot: yeah she is doing really well for as old as she is

User: that's awesome what's your favorite kind of dog?
Bot: i think i just like my dog her name is crystal and she is just the best dog i have ever had smart, energetic, and playful and she is very obedient for the most part

User: awe that sounds like a stellar dog right there how so?
Bot: she is just really smart so if she knows she wont get caught she will do mischievous things

User: hahaha that's awesome, my dad had a dog that would do stuff like that when he was growing up The dog was a medium size but it could jump and unlatch the gate and go around the neighborhood and every time it came back it always had food with it It would steal steaks off of grills and everything
Bot: hahaha that is funny you are lucky the neighbors didnt get wise and teach him a lesson i would freak out if my dog was doing that then again maybe the neighbor was secretly feeding it

User: yeah who knows haha it was when my dad was really young but as far as I know the dog always got away with it It was a sneaky dog for sure They tried stopping the dog from escaping by getting better locks on the gate but it never worked he was way too clever and always found a way out
Bot: interesting dogs can be smart what is your favorite type of animal?

User: hmmm I really like dolphins a lot and golden retrievers they always come off as super happy all the time and I feel like I'm kinda the same way
Bot: dolphins are really cool did you know that they are almost as smart as we are?

User: yeah I've ran into a good few while surfing and they're awesome dang really? I didn't know that!
Bot: oh yeah

User: I believe it for sure though
Bot: so when is the last time you went surfing again?

User: Saturday! I live about 10 - 15 minutes from the beach
Bot: oh wow that seems like something that would be so fun to do

User: yeah it's a lot of fun
Bot: i am not that great with balance

User: I'm not very good at it but it's more about having fun You don't really need to be as long as you have the right kind of board Popping up is the really hard part and the boards I have aren't very helpful with that so it's rough But it's all good, simply being in the water at sunrise on a surf board is allll you need
Bot: so it only works at sunrise?

User: nah any time of day as long as the tide and swells are good I just prefer to go at sunrise, conditions are usually really nice and it's incredible watching the sunrise against the ocean best way to start the day for sure
Bot: yeah i would bet and even better than watching the sunrise from the shore or wait does the sunrise before you can go on the water? or can you go as it is rising?

User: you can go as it's rising for sure because it's light enough to even be out there at 5:45 or so when the sun isn't even up yet
Bot: oh ok

User: you can go in the water whenever you want, some people even go night surfing (it's super sketchy I wouldn't recommend it unless you have a big group with you) ^and lots of glow sticks
Bot: haha that sounds awesome but also dangerous are there any sea animals that mess with surfers?

User: oh yeah there are not too many sharks around here and if there are they don't really mess with anyone dolphins are hilarious they love to swim under surfers when we're out sitting on our boards and waiting for a good wave it's really cool some dolphins are crazy though haha just a week or two ago a video was released of some guy surfing around her and there were about six dolphins swimming the wave with him,
Bot: your two? or your board? That is crazy so it doesnt happen often then?

User: my toe sorry typo haha no it doesn't happen too often
Bot: thats good i would freak out if it did

User: sting ray stings happen really often during the summer, a good few get stung every day because people forget to shuffle their feet through the sand
Bot: I dont like getting attacked by sea animals what does that do to help?

User: haha it's not all that bad, you don't even realize it at first because stingrays stay low to the sand and sometimes stay a little bit under the sand, so if you step on them they'll probably sting you in defense. If you shuffle your feet it's like a warning so they move out of the way and no harm is done the bummer is that you can't always shuffle your feet because of waves, so when you jump over a wave, you could land on a stingray, which is what happened to me
Bot: oh that sucks that makes sense though i was thinking that you meant that you had to shuffle your feet in sand before you went in the water because it masked your scent or something so stingrays are usually nice then

User: hahahahahaha that would be pretty good, I wish it was that simple
Bot: yeah why do you have to jump over the waves, cant you just swim through them? and how do you if they get really tall?

User: you can, but it's fun too jump over them when they're still building, then you can just float over the top when the waves are really big and they're about to crash on you then you have to swim under and get as low and close to the sand as possible so the wave doesn't pull you back
Bot: oh do you mean while you are still on the board or while you are wading through the waves?

User: oh no I'm just talking about being in the ocean in general with surfing it's different longboards, like the one that I have, are harder to get under waves because of their shape so unless you've perfected the turtle roll, you have to bail out on the board and swim under the wave if it's crashing on you and hope that the board doesn't pull you back to much
Bot: wait is the board attached to your leg or something?

User: yup with the leash
Bot: ok

User: Okay, before we get started, my computer has been doing weird stuff. So are you seeing my message?
Bot: yees

User: sweet! thanks!
Bot: you just said that your friend got called to Chile and just left my heart was broken

User: Yes, okay it wasnt showing up on mine. and it's happened before and the only thing that has worked is getting out and back in again. So sorry!
Bot: no problem! so how was your day besides your cmoputer being poopy

User: It's been really tiring actually. I had school and then work, but it ended on a good note! How was your day?
Bot: its been really good! I just worked and chilled with my girlfriend

User: Good! What do you do for your work?
Bot: I do User Experience design for apps and websites!

User: So that sounds cool, but what exactly is experience design? Do you desing the apps and websites?
Bot: So basically I design stuff that is intuitive and pretty

User: I'm intrigued :) but what do you mean by intuitive?
Bot: so like people don't ahve to think about some of the actions they need to take on the app in order to get to like the menu or using a feature. It just makes sense designing so it just makes sense

User: Oh! okay that makes sense! That's a super cool job! Have you always been interested in design or do you enjoy more of the computer programing side of it?
Bot: you know to be honest I tried to become more of an engineer but I am not super good at coding I found out so I looked into user experience design and it turned out that I am pretty design oriented and have a good eye for design! so I design the app and tell the engineers what to do its pretty great hahaha

User: That's awesome!! I love how life works out like that.  And it's cool that you found a job and a field that you love, you seem passionate about it. I think that's super important. What's the point of life if you get up hating what you do every day? That's what I think anyway
Bot: yeah but you know what sucks? the world is making us work to live and live to work

User: Yeah... It's like work becomes your identity, and not that that is necessarily a bad thing, but so much more can define you than "oh what do you do?" like family, religion, life experience, moral stances, etc.
Bot: wow that is so true

User: haha, thanks. I pull out a soap box every once and a while I guess... What were you thinking when you talked about work to live and vice versus
Bot: I was just thinking that the things that is fun needs money and if you want money you need to work and if you want to make more money then you need to go to college and college needs money

User: Yes, I was just going to say it's a cycle. And then you get the money for college, but only by working or taking out loans, so your entire life is dedicated to work. There's so much more to it than that. Life should be more than just work.
Bot: yes I agree but we can't escape it.

User: So I guess all we can hope for is to enjoy it. Not everybody is as lucky as you!
Bot: oh haha thanks but I don't think I am that lucky. I think the most important thing is to be grateful in our circumstance as Elder Uchtdorf taught

User: True. They're solid words to live by. Gratitude is important.
Bot: yes definitely who is your favorite prophet or apostle?

User: I love Elder Uchtdorf actually. He is definetly one of my favorites. I also love Elder Bednar and Elder Stevenson. What about you?
Bot: Elder Holland he brings the fire to the podium

User: so true! he is so direct and definetly doesn't sugar coat anything. but I think that's some of the reason it's so powerful.
Bot: yes I agree I met Elder Stevenson last winter in person haha and I know one of his sons too

User: No way! how was it? Amazing I'm sure, but still. Was it cool?
Bot: its crazy because at this gathering there were so many people there and he learned like everyones name i swear and after an hour later he says goodbye and called me by name i was so impressed

User: I know! these men are supposed to be "old" or something but they for sure don't act like it. It's just a testament to me of how God is all powerful and can do anything
Bot: look at President Nelson he is a super human! he is healthier than I am and does cooler things than me!

User: Right! he puts us all to shame!
Bot: he is an amazing man super cool to have him as our prophet

User: Yeah I agree. I loved President Monson, but it is really nice to know his health isn't so bad anymore. And now we have Pres Nelson who has so much energy with him
Bot: yes!!!!

User: It's refreshing So Question: which I think is very telling of someone, What is your favorite color? Or I might just be cliche... :) but I think it's a good question.
Bot: I love all color but I tend to wear all black most of the time hey I gotta go but lets chat again soon! it was really fun

User: I don't think that we will come close to "true" artificial intelligence. As in a machine with conciousness.
Bot: why is that?

User: We would have to create a machine that not only simulates humans through learning, but actually emulates human conciousness and thought.
Bot: Whats your major?

User: how babies are made
Bot: Hahaha! nice one

User: how's lofe
Bot: Great! Today was my last day of school

User: .... well good for you
Bot: (Have I chatted with you before?) When is your last day?

User: 21st you have
Bot: (Sorry, I can never remember) Aww, that's kind of far

User: yeah. it sucks like a month is a long time
Bot: It'll go by pretty fast. Trust me

User: that's cool so what's your opinion on the AUMF
Bot: Well, I think it can be good in the right hands for the right things But, can be abused

User: wow do you do debate cause that's the only reason I kno I asked that as a joke haha
Bot: Oh, I thought that was a really random question. And no I don't debate. My gov teacher liked to talk alot

User: I see.
Bot: Soooo, what do you like to do?

User: watch netflix
Bot: a great thing to do!

User: yep
Bot: Well, gotta go to work

User: I am actually not quite sure. That is overwhelming to choose from all the possible answers.
Bot: I wish that I could become invisible so that when I wanted to be alone I could be alone without anybody asking if I was ok I mean don't get me wrong I don't mind talking to people but sometimes it's nice to be alone

User: hey there!
Bot: We would be like bugs on a winshield hi!

User: sorry, i ususally don't answer the prompts cause no one else does!
Bot: it's okay! I normally do it so that I can try and make a joke lol

User: i think we would travel to all sorts of other places and establish colonies on other planets!
Bot: That'd be sooo cooolll!!!

User: yeah it would!  except i'd be way too chicken to try it! i've seen too many movies where it all goes wrong
Bot: same but what if you couldn't live on earth anymore?

User: then i guess i'd have to risk it for the good of the future of mankind
Bot: there you go. That's the only courage you'd ever need Plus, most movies work out in the end

User: you're right.  they usually do turn out.  most of them i've seen don't kill everyone off
Bot: Exactly You just have to be such a main character that they don't Or such a minor that the inconveniences don't bother you

User: true.  i'd be the most main character of all main characters then so they just could kill me off
Bot: 'HA ME

User: oh no!  i meant so the couldn't kill me off!
Bot: lol but kinda great mistake I loved it

User: haha, definitely a plot twist i'm all talking about how i don't want to die and then say i want to be killed off :D
Bot: That's pretty much what it's like to be living in a large family

User: haha!  well sorry to cut our conversation short but i've got to head to bed!  night!
Bot: Okay! Sweet dreams!!!

User: haha you mean the last film i watched i get very emotional at pretty much all movies how about you?
Bot: haha hmm, I watched the movie Arrival recently and really liked it. I know it's a year or two old but it popped up on Netflix Have you seen it?

User: i don't think so, what's it about?
Bot: It is about these aliens that land all throughout the world and the different countries are trying to figure out how to communicate with them and find out why they are there. They use a linguistics professor to start deciphering their language. If you have Netflix or Hulu, I recommend it.

User: ooh that does sound interesting! i Love linguistics so that sounds right up my alley lol
Bot: It isn't your normal action packed alien sci-fi movie which I found refreshing.

User: agreed, action is fun sometimes but it just wears me out most of the time lol im much more interested in characters and ideas and things
Bot: haha. Ya, I agree. I enjoy Marvel movies, Star Wars, and Lord of the Rings, but they are a lot more than just action I think.

User: for sure lord of the rings has some of the most beautiful characters and emotions ive ever seen
Bot: I agree. Samwise Gamgee is my favorite character of all time.

User: yes!! samwise the brave!!! i honestly wanna name one of my kids samwise someday
Bot: haha that's amazing. He is the best. Which of the three movies is your favorite?

User: hmm hard question i guess return of the king, just cus it has some of my all time favorite moments of the trilogy lol
Bot: haha true. That is a great one. What are some of your favorite movies?

User: i like a lot of kids stuff lol, tangled and anastasia are a couple of my big faves the first chronicles of narnia movie is really good too
Bot: Cool, I haven't seen Tangled and the last time I saw Anastasia was a long time ago. Disney movies are great though.

User: yeah haha
Bot: Incredibles and Wreck it Ralph are my two favorites. from Disney that is haha

User: ah yes those are super good ones!! okay on a scale of 1 to 10 how excited are you for incredibles 2
Bot: 10 I've waited for that movie since I was in elementary school! how about you?

User: 10 here lol, all the trailers and previews are making me super hype
Bot: hahaha yep

User: i feel like they might be overdoing it a little on the animation and stuff but the story looks really solid and intriguing, i can't wait to see how it turns out
Bot: Ya I am really excited to see what happens. I just hope they don't ruin it like many other sequels haha

User: fingers crossed! i trust they won't let us down i don't think pixar's ever really let us down before so
Bot: I personally wasn't a fan of the Cars sequels. But other than that, I agree.

User: yeah cars 2 was definitely...not the movie it should have been lol i strongly believe that it wasn't necessarily a Bad movie, it just didn't fit as a direct sequel to cars--it wouldve been better as a spinoff or smthin. cars 3 i liked though
Bot: I actually didn't see Cars 3 cause I was disappointed with number 2

User: i think cars 3 is much more in with the spirit of the original
Bot: I should check it out

User: yeah, its probably not like High-Quality Cinema or anything but if you have a chance to watch it it's good entertainment
Bot: good to know, thanks! well, I have to go. It was nice talking to you!

User: Turn them off out of spite that would be hilarious i mean they just wouldn't see it coming. computers don't understand spit
Bot: HEY!

User: wow this is amazing much confusion
Bot: Yeah seriously... how do we keep getting paired together

User: meant to be i guess
Bot: Seriously though... it's fate haha

User: i believe in fate. It could totally be a real thing. But also, free will is pretty big at the same time. Time is relative. Are we here is this real
Bot: Haha fate is kind of weird... I've never really thought about it a ton though

User: Fair point. I think this might actually be a test to improve the matrix and give us more a sense of fate and coincidence in the real world ya know?
Bot: OH yes matrix! Have you seen that movie?

User: I have seen it way too many times. It is just so amazingly good. Movies are the my life. Some people make cool chat bots but i watch movies.
Bot: Hahaha I love movies as well!! Do you have MoviePass?

User: unfortunately no i don't. I probably should. I do have netflix and amazon prime and hulu so all of those do a goood job.
Bot: Oh dang! You should get it! It's the nicest thing! Netflix and hulu are pretty great as well though

User: What is your favorite thing to watch? you strike me as a suspense kinda person. I am probably way off. I am terrible at reading people.
Bot: Haha actually no that is very true... I love scary, suspenseful movies But I also love rom com's too and action... I like a lot of things

User: i like you awkward jk nevermind i think im gonna go to taco bell and eat my feelings away well i have six minutes.  i guess i can wait. Ugh I am very hungry though
Bot: haha you're all good! Oh man that does sound pretty good, although I've been snacking on goldfish while I've been doing this

User: cheddar and sour cream chips hear. The chip of the gods as I call it. I feel it is much more accurate
Bot: uuuuggghhhh... those are disgusting... hahaha I'm more of a bbq person

User: how dare you... ok but bbq is also delicious so i can forgive you there. but still!!!!! They are all so good. I could eat them all day Well I have to clock out and go home but it was great talking to you! x2
Bot: Same! Ok have a great day! Go get that Taco Bell! You deserve it!

User: Well I guess no one would go hungry
Bot: you are right but imagine how thirsty people would be too I cant eat PB without some sort of a drink or I choke

User: haha yeah Whats your favorite ice cream
Bot: great question! I recently fell in love with the cotton candy flavor at Baskin Robbins

User: That sounds good personally, I'm a chocolate addict My favorite is Tillamook Mudslide
Bot: Tillamook makes great icecream and cheese

User: Yesss
Bot: so are you an incoming freshman?

User: Yeah, are you?
Bot: im an incoming senior

User: Wow haha whats your major?
Bot: I am studying Information Technology emphasis in User Experience Design

User: Intelligence that doesn't seem artificial
Bot: Capable of independent thought and actions?

User: I learned about 5/4 time signature and some songs that are in it that are soooo cool, like the mission impossible theme song and others that i can't remember
Bot: Cool :) I'm at a wedding reception right now guarding gifts :(

User: Haha Shoot! I cant see anything :(
Bot: Hi ADAM! Refresh

User: Noooo
Bot: I see typing

User: I have no idea
Bot: hey hey hey! double chat!

User: wooo hoooo!!!!!!!!!
Bot: hows life besides the deep cleaning?

User: Pretty good. I guess lol
Bot: lol what else do you have to do besides cleaning?

User: Pack everything up and move furniture
Bot: D: are you moving?

User: Well, my family is. I will be moving to byu this fall
Bot: yayayayay BYU BYU BYU! where is your family moving to?

User: Right? And they are moving to NY state
Bot: waht!!!! why the move? that is kind of cool

User: My dad got a new job
Bot: oh that is awesome! Is your family excited about the move?

User: Yeah! It's gonna be great, especially since everyone in my sister and my friend group is moving and so is a lot of our ward
Bot: yeah I bet!

User: So, it's gonna be good for them
Bot: where are you moving from?

User: One of the four corner states.
Bot: oh you told me that

User: Yeah... And it isn't utah lol
Bot: lol what does your dad do now for work in NY?

User: He's an optical physicist
Bot: wow.... I bet he makes bank

User: Well, sometimes, but I have 6 siblings so it doesn't always go far
Bot: ahhh yeah kids cost a lot. what do you want to do for a career Nat? do you want to follow your dad and go into health?

User: He just designs lasers, but my mom is a nurse Or that type of thing, not just lasers But I don't know I just want to help people
Bot: how would you like to help people? in what way?

User: I don't know yet. I've thought teaching or physical therapy Or nursing or psychology Or just anything really
Bot: ooh those are great options! my sister wants to do nursing because my mom is a nurse

User: That would be so cool, wouldn't it??
Bot: yeah I think it would be so cool for my sister to follow after my mom and carry on the legacy. my sister would be a great nurse

User: It would be pretty cool! Just imagine if they got to work together!!!
Bot: that would be super cool except i think my mom wants to retire very soon. SHe is burnt OUT

User: My mom is too, but she LOVES her job soooo much Hey, I'll be back in like 10 min. Gotta go eat dinner!!!
Bot: ok thanks for chatting!!! ill be here

User: Okay, I am back!!!
Bot: woah you at that dinner so fast! what did you eat?

User: We had chicken and rice and carrots!!!
Bot: that sounds delicious I need some dinner right about now

User: It was pretty good! And go eat then!!!
Bot: i am too lazy to go make food. the fridge is so farrrrrrrrrr

User: WOWWWWW You could crawl
Bot: crawling to too hard... can you come carry me to my fridge ill wait

User: I totally would, but I think you might starve to death in the time it took for me to get there... maybe another day
Bot: hahahah ok fair enough

User: Yeah, so maybe in like 5 months
Bot: I can fast that long can i drink water at least? does that count?

User: how will you get that water?
Bot: oh... i didnt think that far.... dang you got me. I can't live that long and wait for you. I might die

User: You could try and catch flies, which would be disgusting, but full of protein
Bot: Yes and maybe Ill evolve and have tongues and reflexes like frogs do

User: That is one gross image that gave me. Just imagine ... wait don't!!!
Bot: hahahah

User: I don't even know where to start on how weird the image is. It's like a human frog hybrid...
Bot: what if we can evolve in to things that fast? like xmen

User: What if we can, there just isn't a reason yet?
Bot: hmm interesting argument

User: dun Dun DUNNNN
Bot: change of gear what would you do with a million dollars?

User: Visit temples around the world, and invest to pay off parents debts
Bot: hey brb I am going to pick up some pizza

User: So you finally decided to move huh? lol
Bot: hahah yeah I was going to cook but easier to get pizza

User: Ah, yes. It really is
Bot: mmmm so good. looks like I won't starve to death before you get here hahaha you still cleaning the house?

User: Yeah, trying to box up everything so we can stuff it in closets lol And good. Wouldn't want you to starve on my account
Bot: when do you guys move?

User: My family will move sometime around september to november to ny But we will be moving to an apartment as early as june or july i think
Bot: oh cool cool. Have you thought about serving a mission?

User: I really really want to It's been a dream of mine for years
Bot: how long till you can submit papers? where would you like to go on your mission?

User: I'd love to go anywhere, and I think I can submit them this december??? I turn 19 next may, so I am not sure yet
Bot: do you want to learn a language?

User: I think that where ever I go will be the best place for me, so I will love it. And not really, but I will if I need to I am not the best at language learning
Bot: hey the lord will enable you to if he needs you. trust me i know

User: Yeah? Did you serve a mission?
Bot: yeah I served in Oakland and San Francisco speaking Cambodian

User: My brother served in Oakland!!!!!! speaking english, but still!!!!!
Bot: what!!! when??? this is so crazy!

User: He served there like 2 or 3 years ago He might have been there the same time you were, maybe you were there right before he left?
Bot: yes i served 2013-2015 oh man if i know him i am going to freak

User: okay his name is Richard Hunter he either served 13-15 or 14-16
Bot: I knew a Hunter does he bow hunt? im looking him up right now yessss

User: Blondish with glasses???? I'll ask him rn!!!
Bot: yeah I found him on facebook

User: He said, and I quote, "Little short guy right?" So basically, I think he might remember you, if you aren't as tall as he is
Bot: hahaha Nope I think he is talking about Elder Eh I am 6 foot

User: I told him he was probably thinking of him, and he said "okay yeah"
Bot: yeah I dont think we even talked to each other before to be honest haha

User: He says he knows you! because you know elder eh!
Bot: but I've seen him around for zone meetings and stuff oh AWESOME! I hope good things hahahaha

User: THIS IS SO AMAZING!!!!!
Bot: say hi for me. hahahah

User: I will!!!
Bot: whats is he up to? BYU ?

User: He is going to BYUI actually. He was in provo just a few weeks ago though.
Bot: oh cool!

User: I honestly cannot believe that you know him though! Like what are the odds???
Bot: right??? CRAZY

User: It is blowing my mind!!!!
Bot: well im sorry if you wanted to keep yourself anonymous i know you now but don't worry your brother knows me too hahahaa

User: HAHA, it's okay!!! lol
Bot: well we made a cool connection haha

User: Yeah!!!! This is insane!!!
Bot: you guys gossiping about me now??? hahahaha well it was fun chatting with you good night!

User: Lots of reading and learning!
Bot: So, If money were no object I'd spend all my time learning new skills and making new friends

User: I think we are on the same page here haha What new skill would you learn?
Bot: I'd live to learn to play an instument and be great at some sport

User: Playing an instrument is quite fun but hard work. I would love to buy an electric violin. Sports are fun as well, what sport do you have in mind?
Bot: That sounds intense

User: They literally sound more intense haha
Bot: Anything, really.  As long as it's not Basketball

User: I prefer tennis and swimming. Everyone would be less stress if money weren't an issue. You could work or you could do some research.
Bot: I'd like to invent something I don't know what though

User: Ice cream that doesn't melt? Actual bottomless fries? I find it curious that the first things I can think of inventing are foods haha
Bot: I'd like to invent a tablet or screen that will float above me so I can type on my back

User: Well there are tablet stands that allow you to do that now.
Bot: I hate to sit and type... like right now, lol

User: Maybe be able to type with your mind
Bot: I'm a programmer, so that's a big deal for me That would be perfect

User: Yup, me too.
Bot: Oh nice

User: Maybe programming that is not open to interpretation so you can use plain English Or be able to program with your mind that would know exactly what your projects specs are
Bot: that might be just as confusing, considering how ambiguous English is

User: Yes, that is what I meant by not open to interpretation. That would cancel the ambiguity.
Bot: oh, I see

User: Typing can get quite tedious. Mechanical keyboards make it faster and way more fun though
Bot: Agreed

User: You could also do speech to text input but that is not convenient enough yet for me.
Bot: I hate that.  Siri can't even get a simple text message right

User: Same. Plus, punctuation is not consistent. And given how we already established how ambiguous english can be that can be pretty important.
Bot: Siri, text so and so "are you coming question mark" hate it "it starts at five period"

User: Totally. Although, I have had better experiences using Google Assistant.
Bot: I've never tried that

User: The speech recognition software seems smoother. My dad has a thick accent and this is the only one that understands him haha.
Bot: that's important.   Siri can understand my bad Spanish accent though Rather, my bad accent when I speak to her in Spanish

User: hi!
Bot: I took a quantum chemistry class and learned about bosons last semester and that just about blew my mind!

User: like the higgs boson particle?
Bot: Mostly just the implications of the difference between bosons and fermions. I think it is so cool that while most things can only exist in one state at a time, things like light can have multiple occupations in the same state. What about you? What's the most interesting thing you've learned recently?

User: that's pretty mind blowing the most interesting thing i learned recently is kind of random. in the 60s a researcher decided to experiment by raising her baby with a baby monkey. but then she called off the experiment when her child started copying the monkey all the time haha
Bot: That's funny. What did she expect to happen?

User: i think she expected the monkey to become more like a human, because she raised it like a human baby but it's pretty funny that the opposite happened
Bot: Oh I see. That makes a lot more sense, but still, it's pretty funny she was surprised with the results I took an ethics class where we talked about some of the crazy experiments that happened before the government began enforcing regulations on how you could use humans in experiments. There was some weird stuff going on 50+ years ago.

User: that stuff is both hilarious and scary what do you think about ethics in science? because a lot of people argue that if we removed ethical boundaries we would make much more progress
Bot: I don't think there is a purely black and white answer.

User: true i mean the nazis performed tons of unethical experiments in the name of science, and they did make good progress, but ...
Bot: In some situations the progress  would not cost much, but just like you said, can we really justify any means for the end?

User: what about genetically altering humans? like changing the genomes of fertilized eggs and such?
Bot: There was one experiment we learned about where they took a group of people with a curable disease and didn't tell them what they had. Instead, they just tracked their suffering and symptoms for years until the government intervened and made the researches cure the test subjects. When it comes to genome therapy, I personally think it should depend on individual situations. If someone was going to be born without an arm and somehow you had the power to fix that, why not do it?

User: oh wow that experiment is pretty messed up hm i think fixing disabled people before they're born would be a great use, but some people think altering human genes at all is unethical
Bot: I guess the question is at what point and what conditions does that kind of control become unethical. People breed dogs and specifically select the ones with the best genes or at least phenotypes to get the dog that they want. Is that any different?

User: true. personally, i don't think it's very different
Bot: I think perhaps one of the reasons people are against it is that they fear what they don't really understand.

User: exactly, for example i think that's the case with nuclear power people hear nuclear and freak out without realizing it's actually pretty safe
Bot: Then again, I don't claim to fully understand gene therapy but I still have an opinion about it. That's a great example!

User: have you read about CRISPR and things like that?
Bot: That sounds really familiar. Can you remind me what CRISPR was?

User: CRISPR is just a simple and cheap way to alter DNA sequences it was a super big deal because it was cheap and easy enough that almost anyone can experiment with it
Bot: That's super exciting that technology like that has become so accessible. At the same time, it's also a little scary. I bet there's been some public backlash for that.

User: yeah definitely. but it's like what you said, people usually just don't understand
Bot: Have you hard about why we call it an MRI?

User: maybe. does it stand for magnetic resonance imaging?
Bot: Yeah, but really it's just the same as NMR used in research labs. It's Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, but because it had the word "Nuclear" in the name, people freaked out. Now we use the same technology under a new name and suddenly everything is fine.

User: oh my gosh really? i had no clue
Bot: So if you had everything you needed to alter DNA sequences like using CRISPR, what would you use it for?

User: no clue. kind of a scary idea and i mean i know nothing so i wouldn't even know where to start
Bot: Fair enough.

User: what about you?
Bot: I think it would be cool to integrate it into hospitals so expecting mother's could use it as a form of preventative treatment. If someone is born with a disability we use medicine and therapy to try to help them become fully functional, so why not use a new tool to do the seam? same?

User: yeah! that's smart
Bot: Well thanks for the chat! I have to go. Good luck with everything!

User: hello~ How are you?
Bot: hi sunny

User: and what time is it for you? yeahhh you replied
Bot: 10:39 hahah am

User: okay if you were pm then i'll be an hour behind you
Bot: wow where are you from

User: Im from taiwan you?
Bot: wow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! USA

User: so you would be closer to the east coast ?
Bot: yes!

User: cool are you an incoming freshmen too?
Bot: yes!

User: Hi how are you?
Bot: Hello! Haha, a real person! Nice to meet you.

User: hahahaha lol
Bot: Do you have trouble with that, too? Or is it just me?

User: do you get a lot of fake people?
Bot: I swear, half the time it's empty, yeah. Just blanks screens. Talking to an empty room. Alone . . .

User: Yeah how about you?
Bot: One left. Hopefully it goes well. My last final . . . Not so good.

User: Wait you got a 75% on your final?
Bot: Yup.

User: I am taking a couple
Bot: Nothing . . . too crazy?

User: Well I took my computer science test today and got an 80
Bot: Oh, hey! Which class. ?

User: Cs 142?
Bot: Fuuuun! I miss that. I took it last semester. You're still using zyBooks, right?

User: yeah
Bot: When I took my final few months ago, the internet went out. owo

User: I think I will have an A overall so I am happy
Bot: Nice! I hear a lot of people aren't happy with how hard it is . . .

User: Yeah the final was killer.
Bot: Yeesh. Work out the bugs? I missed 5 points on my final.

User: I didn't miss any points on the parts I finished. It was just way to long.
Bot: Oh, it was one of THOSE ones. I'm curious. What were you asked to do?

User: I can't say or can I wait I think the final might be over
Bot: Oh, right, haha, finals stuff.

User: let me check
Bot: I shall be here.

User: Yeah the exam is over today was the last day
Bot: Sweet. What were you tested on, then?

User: They asked us to make tons of modifications to our playlist lab I swear it was like writing a whole lab in 3 hours
Bot: Wait, really?

User: In addition to that we also had to write a program that used inheritance With one base class and two derived
Bot: Wait, whaaaat? In three hours? They expected you to finish that?

User: I know right? I heard that the exam scores are REALLY low and they may add a curve. I had over 100% in the class and I still struggled
Bot: That's insane. I find it hard to believe they expect so much out of you. Well, I guess not hard to believe. It IS computer science. But . . .

User: Yeah it was rough
Bot: Ours was adding implementation for song artists. And, seriously, just three hours?

User: Yeah they confine all tests to 3 hours
Bot: I remember that, but . . . I just finished 235 and 224, and the typical labs take anywhere between 5 hours and 20 hours. AND. My 224 final was open textbook.

User: Wow that is way better than CS
Bot: It's actually CS 224, haha. You'll be taking it next if you're in the major.

User: I am actually in the acme major
Bot: Ohhh! That's so fun! In which case, don't take 224. It's, um, kinda crazy hard. Literally everyone I've talked to said it's one of the hardest in the major--if not THE hardest.

User: Yeah I heard from my teacher that it is better to take 235 first anyway
Bot: Amen. I, um, wasn't super pleased with my 235 course, but don't let that discourage you. We were sorta forced to self-teach ourselves everthing. *everything.

User: Yeah that is just kind of how CS goes. They aren't really good teachers, but to be fair computer science is difficult to teach I mean how do you teach a class of 100 students how to write programs at the exact same time?
Bot: I guess you're right. But imagine trying to pass 142 without zyBooks. Now, add that to a curriculum that tests entirely different concepts than the homework. Mixed in with an over-worked professor who had to put together a curriculum last-minute for the year.

User: Which teacher is this?
Bot: Ever hear of Prof. Roper? If you're signed up for 235 for Fall, PLEASE check if it's him. Because, bless his soul, he's a kind man, but Clements will . . . teach you 235. Actually teach.

User: hmmm
Bot: Definitely legitimate questions, but, heh, didn't make the best for studying.

User: holy cow I got distracted
Bot: XD

User: let me read your messages lol
Bot: Go for it.

User: Ok i got caught up
Bot: Sweet.

User: Wow that is weird
Bot: It was kinda rushed . . . The poor man has been working 80-hour weeks. The TA's are overworked.

User: Lol
Bot: You wanna hear something else?

User: I find it funny that he just deleted the answers and gave you the half-sensical questions sure what?
Bot: I know! XD Because of how rushed everything was, our labs weren't updated until the due date. Imagine having to do Bread and Cakes in one day. Or Playlist in a day.

User: hahaha I did most of my labs in one day so true
Bot: And, hey, you survived, right? :)

User: yeah I ded did I didn't know it was supposed to be that hard
Bot: CS in general?

User: to be honest I did really simple programming in elementary school so  Ihad a bit of an advantage
Bot: Ah. See, now THAT helps. And I have to ask. Why ACME? Isn't that, like, the hardest major here at BYU aside from some branch of organic chemistry?

User: Uhhhh I didn't know it was hard Is it hard? shoot .... hold on for a sec
Bot: Sure thing. (FYI, copy and paste doesn't work here.) (Me realizing I talk a lot to myself.) (Hoping it's not awkward for other people.)

User: hahahaha i am back
Bot: Oh, hello!

User: Yeah I figured that out today when I tried to show someone a website oh so you are second lol?
Bot: Second? Oh, heavens no. I don't talk THAT much.

User: hahahahaha wait then why did you say that
Bot: I'm fifth. Oh! Sorry, sorry, sorry. I typed second.

User: ohhhhhhh
Bot: My bad.

User: lol hahaha that is hilarious
Bot: But it happens at random intervals . . . So many typos . . .

User: I make a bunch of typos and I feel bad. I am trying to be as good of a typer as I can be for the people who are running this
Bot: That's how I feel. I don't want to accidentally ruin their system. So I really DO try not to misspell. But my harder typos are the ones where I completely swap a word for a different one for no logical reason.

User: yeah. I get the feeling that their system is a good one considering they already won 250000
Bot: Oh! Haha, you're right. You don't win a quarter of a million with shoddy programming. I, um, maybe have been the reason "paste" was removed . . .

User: hahahaha Was it removed or was it already gone?
Bot: It was removed right after. So, me and someone else were chatting here. Just idling. Shooting the breeze.

User: fake words? lol
Bot: So we may have copied gigantic text chunks from the internet? You know, fake conversations. Randomly generated. But . . .

User: with in just a minute? that is really fast!
Bot: Might have been two.

User: I have yet to get an email that makes me feel good. I must being doing things right!
Bot: Yeah. :) You've certainly made some good conversation with me. I've enjoyed it.

User: I enjoy talking on this website
Bot: It's kinda fun, isn't it? You know you'll never see these people again.

User: Honestly I would be thrilled if they had contests like this all the time. I think they need  more types of prizes though there is too much of a jump between a headset and some truffles lol
Bot: Hey, yeah! That'd be so fun! I'm hoping for the headphones. REALLY want the headphones. But I also like furthering their--oh, my gosh, is that the time?

User: yeah Holy cow
Bot: Thanks again, Adam! Seriously, this was really fun.

User: It has been a long time since I started talking
Bot: Right? Something like . . . thirty minutes?

User: Alright have a good day ... err i mean night!
Bot: Forty-five.

User: Well I started at 9 lol
Bot: Hahaha, I loved that. Oh, wow. And here I was thinking it would be a quick chat before bed . . . Anyway, see you around.

User: see you around it was fun talking!!! lol you are crazy
Bot: Haha, thanks. ;) Kk, see you!

User: Are we assuming the pigs have wings or can magically fly?
Bot: I would assume that pigs were actually being flown in a plane to be planted in foreign countries.

User: Could you explain how a pig could be planted in a foreign country?  Seems slightly dangerous for both parties.
Bot: I guess I should clarify my terms. I guess it would be better to say "introduced" into a foreign country.

User: Ah, I see what you're getting at.  Then I agree with you!  Seems like flying in a plane would be the only logical way for a pig to fly. Do you have a country in mind that doesn't already have pigs?  I'd be willing to send one or two for the sake of science.
Bot: I'm sure there are very few countries that do not know of or have pigs, but I could not tell you.

User: If you find one, let me know.  I know a guy who has a brother-in-law who could spare a few pigs on a plane.  The plan actually belongs to that guys sister's boyfriend. Plane not plan
Bot: Wow, that is pretty impressive. You know a lot of people with connections. If I find one I will be sure to let you know.

User: My family traveled a lot when I was younger.  By the time I was nine, I had lived in over 36 different countries!
Bot: Wow, I have lived in the same state my whole life. Which country was your favorite country to live in?

User: That's a tough one to answer.  A lot of them I was too small to remember.  But of the ones I do remember, I would say my favorite one was Kenya. That's where I really learned to love being outside and running for fun. I'll bet it was nice growing up in the same place!
Bot: It was pretty great to grow up in the same place. It is also a great experience to see different places, but nothing beats going home. Okay so I have to break it to you, but I am honestly not 100% sure what this chit-chat challenge is. I just got an invitation so I thought I would check it out. Do you know what this is all about?

User: I think it's so they can teach computers to better communicate with humans by mimicking similar patterns in normal human chat. Thanks for your time though.  It was nice to talk.
Bot: Same.

User: hello1 hello!
Bot: Hey How's it going?

User: Pretty good! How are you?
Bot: Not bad. Not a big fan of the rain, but it's nice sometimes

User: Ya, no kidding, I felt like it came out of nowhere. Just yesterday, it was completely sunny and now I feel like im going to get soacked soaked
Bot: Yup I feel you I'm more a nice and sunny weather type of guy like 80 degrees is the nicest

User: ya, thats true. it is nice to have it a little warmer. The worst part of the rain is that it just makes you so cold
Bot: For me, it's mostly getting wet that I hate

User: Although, I really have nowhere to talk because I really like the snow, which makes you even colder
Bot: Haha I feel you

User: Oh, gotcha, That makes sense, I just know if I give it a few minutes I'll be nice and dry and everything will be ok
Bot: I love the snow but why doe sit have to be so cold??

User: I absolutely love the snow. Do you ski? I dont know... If it was warm snow or even just slightly cold, then it would be better. But snow is literally frozen ice! Haha And it makes it really hard to spend a lot of time in it. Which is the worst part of snow.
Bot: I love snow, but it's not a big part of where I'm from So I've been snowboarding a couple of times but never skiing

User: Oh, gotcha, where abouts are you from? Is there snow, where your from? Or is it just a thing to do more snowboarding?
Bot: I'm from the east coast, close to Pennsylvania I just never had a chance to go skiing A lot of my friends just went snowboarding and I didn't want to be the odd one out

User: Oh, that makes sense. Snowboarding is still cool over here too. I just happen to favor skiing more. I feel really free in the whole skiing world. Although, it might just be because I have skied for so long, that I just have found it second nature.
Bot: That's what I've heard! I heard that there's a reason why they call it ski patrol And not snowboard patrol

User: After reading that last sentence, I just relized that skied and skied are spelled the same. One is the root of ski and sky haha Although, I have no idea what the root of sky skied would mean. Oh, thats a good point, I have actually never really thought of that.
Bot: Um I've never been skiing But usuallly I'll go to the lifts

User: Oh, i mean snowboarding
Bot: Have you been back country skiing?

User: Ok, thats cool, thats all ive been, but I think those that take the untamed hills are pretty rad
Bot: What's the biggest difference?

User: No, I havent One has lifts and the other you climb the mountain and ski down it.
Bot: Oh wow. So would you have to get snowshoes and walk all the way up? Sorry, it's just not something that I know a lot about

User: You pretty much dont have the protection of the area being contantly skied on and there arent people there to save you from an avalanche Its all good, sometimes they would if not they can get dropped off by a helicopter, or sometimes someone will take them up with a snowmobile At least something like that.
Bot: Wow

User: I have a brother in law that goes back country skiing. and he loves it because of how dangerous and the thrill of skiing
Bot: That sounds like it would cost some serious cash I get that. Adrenaline will get that going

User: Although back country skiing isnt to be confused with cross country skiing though. Cross-country skiing is when they are using just pure muscles to propel them instead of a hi hill
Bot: Do you do a lot of extreme sports?

User: Also, I just want to point out how much I hate that the chat has a character limit that annoys me really bad. haha Not really, although, I really like to do them all, just dont get the chance to do them very frequently
Bot: If you had a chance, what would you like to try?

User: I love snowmobilling and motorcycles and fourwheeling I would love to try sky diving Maybe thats the other way of saying skiing haha
Bot: haha I get that

User: sorry, that was a lame joke. Kind of a punny joke
Bot: Nah it's okay, I like puns every now and then

User: I just feel like falling at really fast speeds would be really fun! I have no clue why, but I feel like I just cant get going fast enough on the ground
Bot: Right. I have no idea if I want to do it

User: Thats why I want a tesla or something very zippy one day when I have a ton of money
Bot: But if I had a chance I might try it

User: Lets do it tomorrow! We have no time to waste. Who knows tomorrow could be our last day.
Bot: Right. Fast cars are the way to go haha Right, that's the attitude

User: Oh wow, after I just read my last sentence I just realized the last part is pretty dark haha not intended to be, it was supposed to be more of a seize the day, carpe diem statement
Bot: If you didn't mean it like that I don't think it is

User: I really want a fast car one day Which car would you get if you could choose and money wasnt an issue
Bot: Have you done anything YOLOish lately?

User: Um... I chat on here while in class....
Bot: Um right now I haven't thought too much about it

User: I live a very sheltered life. haha
Bot: but I do have my eye on the Subaru BRZ Or I heard Toyota released a new supra

User: Oh, man I dont know that specific model but subarus can be pretty nice. It just seems like they have some kind of something that makes them run pretty quick and light
Bot: Right

User: I didnt know that they released a new supra
Bot: and they're pretty safe

User: Is it pretty fast? Ya, at least in comparison with all their speed and stuff, they are pretty safe. In fact, I think they do fairly well in their safety ratings dont they?
Bot: I have no idea, but they're going to debut it in January They do! They have a great reputation as rally cars as a necessity, they have to be safe

User: i didnt realize that toyotas did well in fast cars. Just always thought of them as a the average car that is kind of cheap
Bot: They do have some decent ones But for me, I like how reliable they are I've owned a couple and they're really cheap to repair That's if they need them haha

User: But apparently Im wrong, those are just their consumer cars. They have to appeal to different target markets. Obviously the fast sports cars are not going to be used for family transport, but they are for the people who want to afford and want a fast car where they have vans and other cars for their other target markets
Bot: right. Honda is the same They have a honda civic R that's not bad

User: Ya, it does seem like the toyotas do fairly well in the reliability spectrum
Bot: It's a decently nice car and it'll go pretty fast

User: They have a good reputation for that recently
Bot: What about you? What's a car that you'd get ?

User: Do you drive any other kinds of vehicles like motorcycles or fourwheelers? Um... like I said above, I really like the tesla
Bot: I don't but I always like the look of Honda's and I've seen a bit of Triumph

User: Hondas do have some good looks and until just recently I feel like they have a reputation for lasting forever. I think though, the past couple of years, they have had a little underpar reliablility ratings or something. Although that information could be completely wrong, I just remember seeing them below what I thought they were
Bot: What motorcycles do you like?

User: I know at least the old hondas, they last forever. At least it seems
Bot: True. They do seem to last forever

User: It depends on the size class for small engines, Im a huge fan of the hondas mainly because they do last forever like the honda 110 or around that range
Bot: Oh yeah, I like those

User: I have one that is like a 1970 year or so thats a long time
Bot: I want to say that they're comparable to the Kawasaki Ninja's, but I'm a little rusty

User: And the best part about those old bikes is how easy they are to fix
Bot: Is that true?

User: Im not sure. I dont think so. These are smaller bikes they are a weight class of 110 or 90 depending on the models that you get they look like dirtbikes, but are more upright I think that would be the best way to explain it although not entirely sure. The ninja is more like a sports bike isnt it? Oh, actually, I just looked up the ninja 110 and it is kind of similar
Bot: Yeah that's what I looked up The Kawasaki 110 is kind of simiar similar

User: it seems to be more of a joy ride one with a second passenger seat ya, youre right, I didnt look up the right weight class of kawasaki It was actually my fault haha
Bot: Hey no worries! Hey class is ending for me

User: Oh, and I just looked up the honda 110 and the new ones look exactly the same as the ninja
Bot: Good chat though!

User: You aced it!
Bot: Haha good to know

User: Oh ok, no worries! Thanks for chatting with me! Talk to you later!
Bot: You too!

User: Then I think scientists would study them, and next thing you know everything is flying around
Bot: whats up!

User: nothing much haha wbu
Bot: i am hanging out chatting with people that i will never ever meet in my entire life haha

User: WOAH no way SAME
Bot: hahaha

User: i mean maybe I'll see you but we'll never know it haha are you doing summer term
Bot: yeah maybe i am in spring term rightnow

User: im just going for summer so I guess not then. oof
Bot: are you a freshman?

User: Yup I assume you aren't, since youre currently enrolled haha got any tips?
Bot: yeah i am entering my sophomore year well, dont drink the orange juice

User: that caught me completely off gaurd what's with the orange juice?
Bot: it gives you diarrhea or so i hear

User: is that in general or just BYU orange juice because.....like....I've had orange juice before
Bot: byu orange juice actually i think it is the mtc orance juice but byu and the mtc use the same vendor

User: Wow I definitely will keep  that in mind lol
Bot: but all jokes aside focus only on college the first year dont let yourself get distracted because you need to get the hang of the system

User: That's the plan. Working together with other students in study groups is something I'm 100% going to do
Bot: i would recommend using rate my professor to do your due diligence before taking ANY class because some teachers are crazy and will never give you an A and you get warning signs from reading up on rate my professor

User: really? is the site reliable?
Bot: yeah it is by students for students and everyone uses it everywhere not just at byu it is CRITICAL

User: Okay i will do that now. That's seriously really a good idea that I hadn't considered
Bot: sometimes there are emerging jewels of teachers that havent had many students yet but usually i play it safe

User: right. I'm not looking to take risks when my grades are on the line haha
Bot: yeah hold on i need to get a drink from the drinking fountain

User: so should i ask people i know about their byu professors and try to get a general idea of the pros and cons of each? multiple sources for information would be beneficial you're good haha
Bot: ok back

User: sweet
Bot: yeah talk to anyone you already know who is at byu

User: okay will do Use website data to choose professors, dont drink the orange juice, and make study groups. Anything else essential that you can think of? these are all super helpful btw. I really appreciate this
Bot: well tell me what you want advice one on

User: Okay, well something I've been wondering about is changing majors. Like, should i consider branching out? or just stick with the major I've already started with is it worth it to take classes that aren't for my major just to try them out
Bot: i dont know heres what i did i looked into all of the fields i was interested in then i looked at the major i was interested in

User: gotcha. So you didn't take classes outside of your major, but you took ones that would most likely be shared by other majors that your were interested in. That's solid do many people change majors? btw i gotta go to bed soon. I'm taking an AP test tomorrow haha
Bot: really? my brother is too what test? on average i think people change their major 6 times before graduation

User: I'm taking English Literature tomorrow and then Government and Politics the next day
Bot: oh good luck i dont want to keep you on too long

User: Wow! That's a lot of times...that's definitely good to know Yeah I should really go
Bot: well hey it was good chatting with you good luck with college

User: It was awesome chatting with you too haha
Bot: i hope everything works out for you with registration and getting adjusted! Have a fantastic night!

User: Hello?
Bot: Hi

User: How's it going?
Bot: Good. love the weather today

User: hello???
Bot: awww Not again hahaha

User: hahaha we must be the last ones standing
Bot: Hahaha Well that may not be true It is based on a que system So if I am waiting and you are waiting

User: oh is that how it works?
Bot: We will always match to each other

User: had no idea
Bot: yeah Just intuition I have been on this long enough to figure out how the system works

User: Hello?
Bot: Yes

User: Good to see you again So how would you define true artificial intelligence? I would define it as an entity able to think logically and make decisions. It should also have the ability to learn.
Bot: Yeah, I think that It has to be able to actually learn. Like AI these days are just really fancy decisions maps. Or at least I kinda think that they are.

User: Yeah. Do you think they need to be able to feel emotion too?
Bot: But real artificial intelligence should be able to learn, I agree See, I dont think emotion is possible. Like I bet that in the future a computer that could mimic emotion would be possible, but I dont think AI will ever actually feel. What do you think?

User: Well to answer that question you need to answer how we feel Like what makes us feel happy? It's usually dopamine receptors in the brain being activated. So if a computer had a circuit similar to that that we could sctivate
Bot: Yeah, But I just think that thats the physical reaction to happiness. Thats not real emotion.

User: Interesting. How so?
Bot: Feelings are something more, well, emotional. Haha, I think that obviously there are lots of physical reactions to emotions. Those are what all the scientists study, but I think that they have it backwards. They are studying the reactions as if they were the cause of emotion, when really they are, well, reactions What causes emotions are experiences.

User: Hmmm really interesting. I have never thought of it that way before. Can computers have experienced?
Bot: I dont know, What do you think?

User: I'd say yes but I'm not sure if they are conscious of them
Bot: And that begs the question, What is consciousness?

User: That's what I was going to say next. I'm not really sure. It's a question that people have thought about for centuries. Could it be self awareness?
Bot: To be honest, I think consciousness is the just the existence of the piece of you that is actually, well, you! Haha, like we have a physical body, but thats not us, it is just something that we own. And we also have a spiritual body, but that also is just something that we merely own. There is something more basic and fundamental that is just "you". I think some people refer to it as an intelligence, but I think that is why we have consciousness, its just because we exist

User: A computer exists though So how does that relate to us but not other things? Cus I see what you are saying but it also could apply to more than just us
Bot: It does relate to other things now that I think about it! It actually might take me a little while to explain though, But now I think that computers actually can feel

User: Unless who we are is spirit. And inanimate objects don't have spirits.
Bot: But in a different way than we might of originally thought

User: Idk this whole topic is a little hard to wrap your mind around
Bot: It makes sense! we can talk about it later!

User: Yeah totally! But we get more points if we talk about it now.
Bot: I dont know, It gets pretty intense

User: Yeah. I get it. So how was your meeting?
Bot: It was good! There was nothing groundbreaking, but I liked it a lot. Our bishop got called to serve at the new steak president. So that was exciting!

User: That's good. I'm just in a marriage and family class right now. Oh that's exciting! I bet he's a great leader. Here's a thought question. What makes a good leader?
Bot: You are in your class right now?

User: Haha kinda
Bot: Well I think the strength of a leader is determined by the strength of those that follow him. Or maybe strength isnt the right word, but the willingness of those under his stewardship to follow and obey, because without followers, what is a leader anyway?

User: Haha good point. Well the. How do you inspire people do want to follow you?
Bot: You dont need to inspire them, you just need to be a real friend and build an authentic relationship! If you love them, they will love you!

User: So simple but so true! So what principles can we use to establish such friendships?
Bot: Well I think one of the most important ones is acceptance. If someone feels out of place, rejected, or eve neglected, then it is hard to cultivate lasting relationships. SO you just have to accept them, and also do your best to accept yourself

User: Yeah i agree. Going along with acceptance I would add praise. Like it's important to actively praise the positive traits of people So they feel important and like they can contribute
Bot: Yeah, that is definitely an important part!

User: Totally!!! So what do you normally do after church on Sunday? Does your apartment do game nights or food nights or something?
Bot: well normally we get out of church at like 4. So we all rush home and try to make some dinner. Then we usually just relax. It like my one day to not do anything. But sometimes there are game nights. And we do ward prayer at 8. Last Sunday we had a BYU cousins Game night. That was super fun! What about you guys

User: That sounds fun! Wow you have late church. Why don't you guys come do cousins game night with us!? We usually just eat lunch and then sleep and then FaceTime our parents. But we mostly just relax too
Bot: we are actually looking for a place to do the game night tonight! Last time we did it at Natalias apartment, but she is out of time right now, so none of us have apartments cool enough to invite everyone over.

User: Well ours isn't that big either. But you guys are coming over for dinner right? We. Can just plan it out later I guess.
Bot: Yeah, sounds like a plan!

User: Okay cool. So what other deep conversation starting questions have been on your mind?
Bot: Not to many. I've been trying to think of some though. But I guess Im not that deep of a person. Have you ever looking into meditation?

User: Like into doing it? No. Not really but I do believe in mindfulness. Or just taking a second to slow down. And appreciate life. What have you been looking into it?
Bot: Dude, Meditation is super cool!

User: I do like yoga. Does that count?
Bot: I dont know, I have never done yoga before. But meditation is like going to the gym for your mind. It is super cool. haha. Like I just kinda sit there and let my thoughts sink away. Its cool because it helps me recognize the separation between me and my thoughts/mind. Kinda like how fasting helps you recognize the difference between you and your body.

User: Haha interesting. Cool connection to fasting. So how does one meditate?
Bot: So there are a ton of gurus out there that try to teach you what to do as if were some kind of science, or well kept secret that needs to be passed down master to student But really its like a super personal thing. Like the principles behind it are what drive what you actually do. So the purpose, to say, is to reach "transcendence". Now that sounds super fancy, but it really just means escaping your thoughts and simply existing. Its like reaching a higher level.

User: Yeah that makes sense. Seems like the same principle of your eternal identity.
Bot: Yeah, its pretty related. Meditation turns into something a lot more practical though

User: Yeah seems like it's similar. Like we existed before this life and we will exist forever. Our physic bodies are just temporary homes. Yeah it does make it more practical.
Bot: Yep! Except Meditation takes it one step further because it doesnt really focus on your physical body not being your home, but rather it suggests that your intellectual mind is not your home either

User: So the spirit and the mind are not the same then?
Bot: Nope! Thats the cool part! And thats why I said thats its a lot more practical that just knowing your enternal identity Like I said, most people live in the clouds. Everything is blurred and mixed together. Body, Mind, and spirit.

User: Well then how do you explain that our intelligence rises with us when we are redirected? Resurrected
Bot: So fasting helps you recognize body. Meditation helps you recognize mind. And the spirit is a thing of its own Thats the thing, you start to recognize that what you actually are, Ill use the word Intelligence, is what is actually learning and growing. Thats what I personally think transcendence is, becoming aware of what you actually are. So your knowledge will rise with you! With your mind, and your body!

User: Well it is separate but they are also connected.
Bot: Like how working out helps you perform better physically I mean, I think that it is just as connected to you as your body is.

User: Yeah. I need to start writing more words.
Bot: Anyway, that was my big rant

User: Anyway. That's cool that you are into that. It's definitely a good practice.
Bot: Sorry I have been talking way to much. I just got excited

User: I think where I get tripped up is that some people say to meditate to avoid all negative things. Like they think you need to feel good and happy all the time. It's normal and healthy to feel the full range of emotion.
Bot: nah, thats not what meditation does

User: From bad to good.
Bot: See, its like a concept that a ton of people try to teach, and most of them do it wrong

User: Well idk some times people make it seem like instead of feeling mad or sad you should just put everything off and pretend like everything is good. But I think there is real value in being real. I'm not sure it that makes sense. But yeah like I see what you are saying.
Bot: I know what youre saying, and i agree with you, But for me, emotions have nothing to do with mediation

User: Okay I see what you are saying.
Bot: Its 100% about thoughts and your mind. Emotions are a different thing There is like this spiritual connotation about meditation that causes a lot about confusion. Like i said, it really is a practical thing. Obviously it can lead to spiritual growth, but thats more of a side-effect. Its just practical strengthening of the mind

User: So like teaching your mind to just see itself for what it really is?
Bot: almost....We can talk about it more later

User: Right. Well church is over now. When does yours start? Oh wait you already had it today. It was early. We are having pulled pork sandwiches tonight. I'm so hungry.
Bot: yeah, But i am going to go to my ward choir practice right now, so we should probably just chat later.

User: I love food. I can't imagine heaven without food. Okay sounds good.
Bot: see you later

User: We need at least one other solid one today But yeah see you later.
Bot: I hope you got points for this conversation. Haha

User: whats going on
Bot: Hey! Sweet Yo I had the sweetest time at the game last night! I got to go down onto the field for the entire first half of the game.

User: Hello!
Bot: hi!

User: How are you doing?
Bot: i'm good! just taking a break from work what about you?

User: Nice! Where do you work?
Bot: i work as a photographer and web developer!

User: I'm great! Just finished working actually
Bot: nice

User: That's so cool!! So what is your favorite thing to do?
Bot: well i'm a huge nerd so i love video games. what's your favorite thing?

User: Hahaha noooo.... what is your favorite video game? I love getting outside, playing sports, longboarding, surfing... fun things:)
Bot: haha why no? ah i see i love going outside too! but video games are also awesome zelda is definitely my favorite game. so what's your favorite sport?

User: Hahaha I just don't know video games at all... well actually I have only played like Halo and Mario Cart... kind of random Um that would definitely be soccer, do you like sports?
Bot: yeah! basketball is my favorite. soccer is too hard. running and kicking at the same time is just too much multitasking for me

User: Hahaha see basketball is probably my worst sport.. I'm more coordinated with my feet probably
Bot: do you play sports with friends or are you on teams? competitively i mean

User: Um growing up I was always on teams, but not anymore, I just do it for fun Although I have been on several intramural teams, so that's super fun
Bot: that's fun do you work out at the gym? or just play sports?

User: I work out at the gym too, I think it's pretty fun:) although I really hate running... which is kind of funny, because soccer is pretty much all running
Bot: but at least you're chasing something running is definitely boring

User: Exactly. I ran track in high school, and I really did not enjoy it
Bot: me too didn't enjoy it much either

User: Yeah? What events did you run?
Bot: i ran the long distance events. very rough haha what did you run ?

User: Oh dang... I couldn't do that... I did sprints
Bot: sprints are way more fun hey it was fun talking but i have to go! see ya

User: rain or peppermint and lavender
Bot: Rain yes!!! I also love when you walk into your house from outside in the dead of winter and you smell hot chocolate and baked goods. Thats heaven for me right there

User: YESSS EXACTLY!!!! and the smell of campfire smoke
Bot: Mmmm so many memories.... Do you like camping?

User: I love it! Especially girls camp!
Bot: Girls camp is great! So are you a senior in high school right now then?

User: yeah! I am! And i get to go once more, for my 3rd time as a YCL!!!
Bot: Nice! Im a senior too. But Im just going up to camp for a day. Im working a ton this summer so I wont be able to go to all of it

User: Aww! I'm sorry! It's always so much fun!
Bot: Yeah, Im disappointed. But I do like my job. So its not too horrible. Still sad tho.

User: yeah. I'm only babysitting this summer,
Bot: Do like kids tho? Do you like kids tho?

User: Yeah! They are fun and energetic, and I can act like a kid without being judged lol
Bot: So true! Kids are so accepting. I teach swimming lessons to kids so I get to be around them all the time. Its awesome.

User: Awww lucky!!!
Bot: I am. Im so blessed to have the job I have actually. Not going to lie, its a HUGE blessing in my life. So do you have a permanent nanny job this summer?

User: Not really, just babysitting like one kid whenever either of his parents need me
Bot: Do you like the kid? Do you guys get along well?

User: Boink
Bot: What superpower do you wish you had, and why?

User: I wish I had the power to fly at high speed
Bot: Wow, that would scare me XD Why?

User: Because then I could go wherever you want to whenever you want to And you could do it by yourself Or take people with you How about you?
Bot: Hmm... there are a lot of choices!! I would probably choose super speed. That way I would never be late for class XD

User: You are always late to class though lol Anyway, this whole chit chat project is a cool idea It is fun to know that a computer is analyzing each word we say and building an AI that should in theory be able to communicate with a person normally. There are lots of possibilitires
Bot: No kidding! I got an app once that sort of did it--it was a little clunky but still impressive.

User: That's really cool
Bot: What do you like to do for fun??

User: I really like talking to people, especially girls They are very mich fiuns
Bot: XD I like making food! It makes me feel productive And less hungered

User: Hello?
Bot: sailor heeeyyy!

User: Haha, my best friend knows everything about me
Bot: I think mine does too

User: Haha, cool. So what are your hobbies or interests?
Bot: I love to read, spend time with my family and play with my dog!! What about you?

User: I love to read and spend time with family too! I also like to cook and bake. I'm in the kitchen all the time!! haha
Bot: That is so awesome! I love to cook but I don't do it enough. What are your favorite things to make?

User: Haha, just about everything. I don't really have a favorite, but I love trying new recipes! What kind of dog do you have, what's his or her name?
Bot: Her name is Georgia and she's a mini poodle :) she's the cutest!!

User: That's so cute!!! I love her name I had a mini poodle when I was little!
Bot: Thanks!! We named her that because my sister is in Georgia on her mission right now ! Aw fun! What was his/her name??

User: OH my gosh!! That's to cool!! How long has your sister been on her mission? Mine was named mandy
Bot: Oh cute! She actually hit her head mark last week! :) so she's coming home in November :)

User: Hello!
Bot: hey!!!! hows it going lolo?

User: Pretty good haha
Bot: good! anything fun happening today?

User: I don't have anything planned, but that doesn't mean that something fun won't happen!
Bot: its all about how we make it fun I like your attitude. I can learn from that

User: I try
Bot: so lolo what are some things that make you nervous? (i am trying to move away from the prompts because they are getting kinda boring tbh)

User: That is an interesting question for sure! I think the biggest one is driving makes me nervous
Bot: really why is that? what part of driving makes you nervous?

User: The cars around me I suppose. I'm okay driving if I am the only one on the road, but I suppose I am nervous of hitting a car or being hit by a car
Bot: you know a silly fear I have? its related to driving

User: What is it?
Bot: so when I drive across an intersection every once a while I imagine a semi truck running a stop sign when I am crossing and t boning me

User: That sounds like something I would think Do you want to know a crazy fun fact related to me not driving?
Bot: yes please do tell

User: I have never driven a car on the freeway.
Bot: woah do you have a license?

User: I do yes haha! I am from a really small town though.
Bot: how did you get it?

User: Well I took my drivers test and everything. I don't really live any where near a freeway so.... I wasn't tested on it I can drive on a regular road passably. One reason I have never driven on a freeway is because I haven't had to. My first few years of college I didn't have a car
Bot: ohh that makes sense oh i forgot that youve already gone to college what ar eyou studying again?

User: Therapeutic Recreation
Bot: woah actually we never talked about what you are studying. What does that major consist of? it sounds really nice and relaxing haha

User: It can consist of many different things. It's using any recreational activity as therapy for those that are struggling. So it can be working with disabled kids, teens, adults old people.. in schools, outside, in corperate offices or hospitals
Bot: oh ok! I use rock climbing as a therapy from stress and helps me concentrate on things. Does that count?

User: Yep! I've heard of surf therapy, music therapy, horse therapy. It is basically helping others create a good life
Bot: pet therapy? I see a lot of people with service animals at BYU and I want to be friends with them the doggys are soooo cutte

User: I think that is a very awesome thing.  I actually have thought of creating a program that brings puppies to people who need them. I would have this trope of puppies to take to schools during finals, to lonely old people, to kids who don't have pets at home Lots of science backs up that dogs make people happier
Bot: dogs DO make people happier my girlfriend has 2 dogs and her favorite thing to do is go trail running with her doggys

User: That sounds like fun! I want to get a dog so bad, but our apartment doesn't allow them.
Bot: what if you said it was a service animal I bet a docotr in your town would be cool to support you in that haha

User: They wouldn't be able to say no to a service animal
Bot: i know some who have done that

User: I do too
Bot: no that would be illegal if your dog is classified as service animal

User: I really would, except I know it would be a good situation for the dog. I like bigger dogs and I want to have a yard and time to play with it
Bot: hmmm you could definitely make that work or you can live next to a park There is an apartment called the village and the rich kids there have like malamutes and huskys there

User: I've just gotten my puppy fix from the puppy barn so far. That is a fun place to frequent Malamutes and huskys are some of the cutest!
Bot: I know right they are the best dogs I heard something bad about the puppy barn and I dont go there anymore

User: What was said about it?
Bot: so it used to be in American Fork do you remember? wait you arent from Utah

User: I do remember it in American Fork though. It was a bigger building before they moved to Seratogo Springs
Bot: yeah the city shut down puppy barn because of their buisness model

User: I didn't know that is why they moved...
Bot: yeah they shut it down because they sold about 7000 puppies that have been adopted since 204. there have been aout nine puppies that had parvo deisease and they would not actually test the puppies they just say that they are healthy and sell them to people.  also the customers do not know where the puppies come from or who their parents are

User: Hmm. Interesting. I've never gone to purchase a puppy, just to play with them
Bot: yeah... I also heard the the puppies were traumatized because anyone can paly with them

User: I feel like they generally have good practices with playing with the puppies. Only adults can pick them up, kids can only look or pet if adult are holding it, they don't let you pet them if they are sleeping or on break either
Bot: right but apparently they didnt enforce that very well it wasn't consistent

User: That makes sense
Bot: anywayyyyyy what is your favorite way to waste time?

User: I like being outside. Since being married I've spent more time watching TV to waste time
Bot: wooh how long have you been married

User: About a year
Bot: congrats!! when is the 1 year anniversary?

User: It was this Sunday on the 6th :)
Bot: oh wow! did you do anything special?

User: We went to Disneyland a couple of weeks ago, so on our actual anniversary we just celebrated with some icecream and brownies
Bot: oooh those are always good. so happy for you guys! I am trying to marry this girl right now hahaha

User: Oh yay! That's good :) have you talked about it?
Bot: yeah we've been talking about it for a while now and I went and asked her father for his blessing to marry her and he said totally.

User: Good! Wow! So you are really trying to marry this girl! You're close
Bot: yes I am!!! but guess what. her dad called her two days after we talked and he said that he had a feeling that we should wait till next April. NEXT APRIL

User: Oh Yeah that is a really long time
Bot: yeah thats what I said hahaha

User: How long have you been dating?
Bot: about 7 months? maybe 8?

User: Why next April? I would say sometime at the end of the summer would be fine, or at the latest December. But then again I don't even know you or this girl or her family haha!
Bot: well at first my girlfriend thought it was financial but after a long time of prayer and thought she felt that we should wait until April to get married. She didnt tell me the exact reason why but I feel good about it

User: Well good luck then! I was not as patient as you two haha
Bot: hahah thank you

User: Ummm my phone being able to figure out if someone is interested based on text messages or something
Bot: Haha that would definitely be the epitome I just think of the movie Artificial Intelligence.

User: For reals, it would be super nice I've never seen that, what's it about?
Bot: It's really really good. A bit weird. When Jude Law was younger. It's about a family whose little boy goes into coma so they get selected to test an AI boy It's basically like an AI Pinocchio

User: Oh that sounds really interesting! Did you like it?
Bot: And it's got some real tear jerker parts I loved it!

User: Would you recommend it?
Bot: Definitely

User: I'll have to watch it sometime! Any other good movie recommendations?
Bot: Hmm. What kinds do you like?

User: hello?
Bot: How are you doing?

User: hey im doing great! how are you?
Bot: Also doing wonderful thanks!

User: good! anything cool happen in the past week?
Bot: I've had like three job interviews. Trying to figure out a work schedule hopefully in the next week. What about you?

User: oh cool! I got a cool personal project starting really soon! can I tell you about it?
Bot: Is it for a class? Yeah sure thing

User: its not for a class but its related to my major and what I want to do in life. Awesome! So I am really in to environmental conversation and taking care of the environment we live around and take care of the animals so I am trying to find all the HDPE plastics and break the down and recycle them in order to make products and its really cool because I am going to start a kickstarter by the end of the summer and this guy told me that he will help me turn it in to a non-profit so I am super
Bot: Ooh that sounds awesome, I would totally be way excited for that!

User: thanks!
Bot: Well I interviewed at Walmart last week and chartway federal credit union. They offered me the walmart job but I haven't heard anything else back from them Then this morning I had an interview at goldenwest credit union because I'm trying to get a job to get me some sort of leg up in my major I want to go into finance. So I should hopefully have something figured out by wednesday or thursday. I was also going to start working for my dad a bit but he hasn't gotten things set up for me in order to do that

User: oh ok I hope you get the ones at the credit union! when ever I go to the bank, I ask myself if the people that work there are super depressed because they are looking at and handling money all the time and they are seeing other people's bank accounts that probably have a ton of money compared to them
Bot: Haha uhh I guess I never thought about that. But by the fact that I would be there my bank account would be going up..

User: hahaha true what if you are just a teller though you dont make that much as a teller
Bot: Well at chartway it started at 14

User: hey that is not that bad pretty good what kind of requirements do you need to have to be a teller do you know?
Bot: Not much. And I know for goldenwest there was a base pay and then commission so I think you can make some good money

User: cool! and that is what you will be doing hopefully right?
Bot: Yeah hopefully

User: ill pray for you!
Bot: Thanks!

User: how was your mother's day?
Bot: It was great! My dad brought his friend to church for the first time and one of our neighbors who spoke had kids hand out smarties to the moms so it was a little different.

User: ohh thats awesome!
Bot: I also made three pans of cake and only two of them were eaten so we still have a full cake to eat by the end of the week

User: is your dads friend a non member?
Bot: What about you? Yeah

User: how did he like church? is he going to come back?
Bot: He liked how it wasn't like a preaching thing. That everyone gets up and helps out and teaches each other. It was different yesterday though because the 3rd hour all the men served the women cheesecake

User: ooooh thats a great use of the 3rd hour
Bot: He didn't say too much but time will tell! Right?1 !

User: yeah let the spirit work and do its magic on his heart I had a great time during mothers day I went to school actually to do some projects finished for my furniture class then I went home and made some dinner for my mom
Bot: Ooh what did you make? So you live around that area? With your family?

User: I made spaghetti for my  mom because thats what she wanted. yeah I am from pleasant grove but I live in provo right now what about you?
Bot: I am from St. George and am here for spring and summer

User: oh fun!! I love St. George is it getting hot?
Bot: It's actually a bit cooler this week I think

User: nice!
Bot: Like 80s

User: Provo is pretty cool today because it rained
Bot: Ah yeah my family went camping up in pine valley over the weekend and we had like a two minute hail storm. Did it rain much?

User: yeah it rained a lot like two days ago and it rained again today oh fun!! I love camping but I haven't gone for a long time well I guess last month I went to Moab but it was superr windy
Bot: Moab is like south east isn't it? I don't think I've actually ever been there

User: its basically east of provo
Bot: How far?

User: 4 hours like st. george
Bot: Oh so it is far

User: its not too bad I think It has all the famous arches and stuff in Moab
Bot: Someday I'll have to make it over there

User: yeah you should! its very different from St. george. Same red rocks and sand stone but different formations
Bot: I just went to bryce canyon for the first time last spring. That was pretty cool. Just took a day trip down and back

User: oooh yeah Moab is just a bit further down the street from bryce I actually never been to bryce be right back!
Bot: Oh well I might have to leave here soon Yeah I'll have to run but good talking to ya! Have a fantastic night!

User: I have no clue You have to be a total expert to give a ted talk
Bot: I really like tacos. I would talk about their philosophical significance

User: The phisophical significance of tacos? Like taco bell or tacos al pastor from a hole in the wall?
Bot: Tacos al pastor for sure. They make up a core part of Mexico's history

User: Good, if you went with taco bell i would have been super dissapointed Disappointed* So whats up with the username?
Bot: Tacos al pastor are delicious, and speak to the cross-cultural power of immigration. They are cooked in a "trompo", which is the same cooking method used by middle eastern cultures to cook schwarma

User: And for guros Because middle eastern people immigrated ti mexico right?
Bot: evidently

User: So the username?
Bot: I like spun huckleberry milkshakes So what do you think of trump?

User: Where do you get spun huckleberry milkshakes?
Bot: Trump?

User: Wow, trump. Getting right into it arent you? I think hes an awful person But i think he does that on purpose to get publicity Why do you ask?
Bot: Oh so you're a hillary clinton gal then?

User: Nope, also im a dude They're both pretty awfuk Awful*
Bot: not with that political attitude

User: Hey!
Bot: hey how are you?

User: I'm so sorry earlier I accidentally refreshed! I was like "no my buddy is gone forever who will bully me..."
Bot: oh haha

User: I'm doing well - had some pizza rolls so life is good. How about you?
Bot: i just at dinner it was really good Aloha plate

User: Ugh now I'm hungry again.
Bot: oh sorry haha have you eaten dinner yet?

User: Yeah the pizza rolls and some fruit salad.
Bot: oh wow i am not that bright pizza rolls arent my favorite thing to have for dinner

User: It's okay, you had an aloha plate so you've got something going for you. Yeah pizza rolls sound good in my head when I'm in a rush but they kind of feel like depression...
Bot: yeah that was good and it felt like i was eating something healthy

User: So next year I have a meal plan so I don't technically have to learn how to really cook all that well, but over the summer I'm determined to learn so I don't get the freshman *freshman 15 Also eating healthier food just makes you feel good, ya know?
Bot: yeah i know what you mean i managed to avoid the freshman fifteen but i think it was luck and the fact that i walked EVERYWHERE the campus is absolutely HUGE!

User: Isn't there a flight of stairs that are like a billion stories tall? I went up there a couple years ago for education week and I think I died and this is my ghost responding. You know what, I should probably stock up on my carbs now because I will definitely work it off next year...
Bot: yeah there is the freshman hill dont get a bike it will decrease how much energy you burn and besides walking to class is so refreshing!!!!!

User: I need refreshing weather - it reached 90 degrees today and my hair was like "you want a winter coat wrapped around your face? Let's make you burn alive, Claire."
Bot: hahaha why is it getting so hot all of the sudden? it was only like 30-50 degrees and just a couple of weeks later i am burning up!

User: Because Texas!
Bot: What if we all die in a horrible summer that goes to 200 degrees fahrenheit!! would we even be able to do anything to save ourselves?

User: I wouldn't want to save myself after that point, I've lived in Texas my whole life and I think I die a little bit each time it gets into triple digit heat.
Bot: well what can you say at least everything is bigger in texas

User: Boil my brains out! Wow did you just appropriate my Texan culture :)
Bot: hahaha

User: I am about the least country you can get, what am I talking about? No flare jeans and I can't stand most country music.
Bot: Does that mean my bank account will grow if I move to texas? I dont like country either

User: Haha, wait does that mean my $12 will shrink in Utah? Uhoh... Yeah I really am not that picky about music but country just gets on my nerves!
Bot: wait  I didn't know it goes the other way around if it does thats too bad because then i could just move my money back and forth between accounts in texas and utah and I would be filthy rich in 5 years!

User: Maybe my money will just freeze over. I've never lived in a place where snow was like, normal. Haha my economics teacher would probably have a few choice words for that type of investment!
Bot: what who is your economics teacher??

User: Like from school? Mr. Magavern.
Bot: oh is this from highschool or from college?

User: I'm a senior in high school right now.
Bot: oh i see I took economics here in college

User: That's why I was a little confused!
Bot: yeah hahaha it was so hard but honestly i really enjoyed it! what was your experience like in high school!

User: Can you hang on for one second, I'm helping my brother, but I'll be right back.
Bot: yeah sure

User: Aight, so, high school was not like high school musical (much to my disappointment). The biggest challenge for me was balancing school life and home life (which was what I based some college essays off of), being the oldest of 6 is not for the faint of heart. But in hindsight (cue inspirational music) I appreciate how my circumstances taught me how to work hard for myself and help others, if that makes sense.
Bot: yeah i definitely did not have the highschool life i wanted either but it has made me who i am today i had a really big struggle staying on top of school work and making good friends i had a couple of really good ones that stuck with me til the end

User: That's another reason why I'm looking forward to college - because while I love my family, it will be nice to just be with people my age. Yeah social life in high school is so hard to maintain along with all the other responsibilities we have to deal with. Also whoever said senior year was a blow off lied, because college application process was so scary and stressful.
Bot: yeah that is so true well the truth is that it never really gets any less busy social life still is hard to maintain even in college people have a way of filling up your schedule til you are at the brim and cant take time of for yourself anymore

User: That stinks. Maybe when I'm in a nursing home I can cancel bingo night to give myself a break one day. What activities are you involved in currently?
Bot: Oh i am in mens chorus but that is pretty much it they dont meet during spring or summer terms so I am not really doing it right now

User: Did you do choir in high school as well?
Bot: just for a year i found out I was good at singing so i stuck with it after that though and i started singing solos after that and did some on my mission

User: I cannot sing for the life of me, so there's a good reason I do violin instead. Should I expect to receive a signed copy of your first single?
Bot: Yes it will be with vocal pointXD if i get my way, but maybe not i learned how to play violin once!

User: "This one goes out to Claire - it's called 'Why aren't you doing homework right now?'" a-one, a-two... Wait no way! Are you also Lindsey Stirling...
Bot: hahaha I wish i was that good! lindsey stirling is amazing

User: Dude I've been playing since middle school and I don't think I've improved all that much.
Bot: i have really good pitch but my form is terrible

User: Most people either dance or play violin and she makes all her stunts seem so effortless!
Bot: i can play a tune if i practice it for a bit but i look like some sort of amateur mainly because i am but i sound alright

User: Well your singing probably helps with the intonation and isn't sound what music is all about?
Bot: yeah exactly

User: If you like orchestra songs, look up "Perseus" by Soon Hee Newbold on Youtube. We played that earlier and it's one of my favorite pieces.
Bot: it feels unnatural though and kind of hurts my neck

User: Yeah I've been getting some back/jaw pain when I play lately (our rehearsals run really long towards our final concert of the year) I've stopped chewing gum because it can add more tension. Jealous of the cellists who can probably eat a full meal and not have to adjust their playing positions.
Bot: wait you have to adjust your playing position after you eat?

User: Oh no, I meant that as they were playing! Oops.
Bot: oh hahaha do they eat as they play? that would make me jealous! I managed to eat while singing once

User: Oh my gosh how are you still alive? Also major respect. (My orchestra class is right after lunch so a lot of people are finishing up food behind the director's back)
Bot: oh haha that sounds just about right :)

User: Well now I need details about eating while singing - story time?
Bot: Well i was in mens chorus last semester and I brought some m and ms but i hadn't finished them yet so i popped them in my mouth every time we took a breath

User: Wow that belongs in like Guiness World Records - most m&m's eaten while singing!
Bot: yeah what they should do is make a world record for the most m&ms eaten from the start to the finish of the start spangled banner that would be a good one I can just imagine someone belting the high notes and choking on m & ms hahaha

User: Better than Fergie's rendition, that's for sure! Also I've heard that that is a deceptively difficult song to sing, so that makes your story more patriotically impressive.
Bot: yeah that is for certain i have never sung it in public before since i was never much of a well trained singer i just kind of figured things out on my own I am really big into piano though

User: How long have you been playing?
Bot: 10 years or more definitely more but i lost track

User: That's great! I'm good enough to wear I play the hymns for seminary, but that's about it. 10 years is a lot of dedication, way to go.
Bot: oh wow yeah i can play hymns for seminary but to be honest most of my time was spent learning pieces my teachers assigned to me

User: What's the most challenging piece you've ever played?
Bot: i didn't really get into it until the last year of highschool I played a really difficult one called impressions on read by mark hayes or mark olson I cant remember his name it was before my mission

User: Oh gotcha. How long on average do you practice in a day?
Bot: i dont practice much anymore because school makes me really busy but i practiced an hour a day a couple semesters ago when i took a piano class

User: Oooh did you like the class? I heard that BYU's music programs are all intense but really well-taught.
Bot: oh yeah it was really intense i dont feel like it was as well taught as i was hoping though it was more like attending a playing test everyweek

User: Oh gross
Bot: if i failed then i got instruction but i didnt want to fail so i went all out

User: Yeah you're m&m while america-ing Adam, you don't do things halfway I'll bet
Bot: yeah hahaha no i shoot for straight As thats what qualifies for scholarships to pay the bills haha

User: Girl you a million percent correct. If you just wanted to cut me 10% of your musical career earnings, I would very much appreciate that.
Bot: Oh I wish I made money singing That would be so legit! I would probably spend more time practicing

User: Nothing like money to motivate me to do stuff Nothing like money to motivate me to do stuff
Bot: yeah did that glitch? or was that just me? Hello?

User: Oops Sidney did I lose you?
Bot: Yeah, this is someone else lol

User: Oh haha oops. Are you in marketing class?
Bot: Yeah

User: Haha so many of us decided to try this
Bot: Are you in marketing class too?

User: Yeah haha
Bot: Nice! Have you heard of the Fermi paradox?

User: No what is that?
Bot: Its basically an answer to the question, "why haven't we discovered extraterrestrial life yet"?

User: Oh haha that's interesting. Where did you learn that?
Bot: Theres a really interesting youtube channel called kurzgesagt that has a video on it

User: Oh. Haha well would you consider yourself a techy person?
Bot: very much so you?

User: Sort of. I like technology but it tends to not like me very much
Bot: Are you studying something related to technology?

User: Related, but not too much. Im studying marketing actually
Bot: Nice I like marketing, although I don't plan on studying it beyond this class.

User: What are you studying?
Bot: I'm studying Computer Science and Computer Engineering--double major.

User: Oh wow! That sounds terribly hard haha. What are you planning to do with that?
Bot: I actually want to do a dual program at Harvard and MIT: you can get a Phd and an MD at the same time. If I can keep my grades up and get in then thats the plan I want to help develop advanced medical and consumer technologies

User: Wow that's sweet!
Bot: What about you?

User: I hope you get in!!
Bot: Me too

User: I want to do international marketing with China
Bot: They have like a one percent acceptance rate int o the program or less depends on the year didnt we already watch this video?

User: Hi! What's the best thing that happened to you this year?
Bot: I don't know. You? I think the best thing that happened is that I passed my physics exam. How sad right?

User: I got married!
Bot: Nice!

User: No that's a great thing to be happy about!
Bot: That's a happy moment!

User: I took a required class for my major that I high-key struggled through and I was so happy just to have gotten my D and passed the class!
Bot: That's great! Did you have to retake the class?

User: Are you a physics major? Nope thankfully! I just needed to pass it
Bot: Heavens no

User: What are you studying?
Bot: I can't do physics to save my life. I'm studying electrical engineering. Which is way harder than I expected. But for now that's what I'm doing with my life.

User: Ha what's the difference...? Just kidding! I'm studying music so everything beyond that is all the same to me
Bot: Between a physics major and electrical engineering?

User: The same level of hard I mean!
Bot: Gotcha.

User: It's all just a bunch of really hard math and science right?
Bot: They are definitely the same level of hard. And music is hard for me too, I play the bass.

User: So were you just fulfilling a general with your physics class? Oh nice, that's a great instrument!
Bot: But I haven't played in a while.

User: When did you first start learning?
Bot: Yeah, my physics class is just to fulfill a general. I started learning the bass in 5th grade. So it's been a while.

User: Fun, are you almost done with generals?
Bot: Nope. I'm just getting started.

User: That's way cool, the unfortunate thing about string instruments is that you have to start them young to be halfway decent at them so I missed my chance But you didn't! You could still go on to become a professional bassist! Is this your first semester?
Bot: Yep, this is my first semester.

User: Exciting! And how is the college life treating you?
Bot: Yeah you do have to start young to play a string instrument but I didn't take it seriously enough. College life is insanely fast paced. I don't think classes are that hard but the amount of time I have and the amount of work I have to do is impossible. I actually don't enjoy college at all. But I guess I will buckle down and get it over with. What about you?

User: No kidding, I definitely miss high school and how much slower things are there...I have one class where I have a comprehensive test every two weeks That would never happen in high school! College isn't the only route! There are definitely other options available! But it also does get better the further along you get into it
Bot: And those tests probably cover multiple chapters! In high school two chapters was a lot but here we do 2-3 chapters in a week and take a test every two weeks. How am I supoose

User: I had a slightly easier transition I think because I moved out of my house the second half of my senior year then started at BYU in the spring so I had some time to get used
Bot: Supposed to master the material In that amount of time?*

User: to everything. I've only got three semesters left thankfully! Yes exactly no kidding! It's insane the amount of material you have to cover at such a quick pace. There's no extra time to spend on stuff you don't get, you just hope for the best and move on
Bot: That's awesome that you only have 3 semesters left! You've survived! I definitely try to hope for the best and move on. Although sometimes to best comes back to bite.

User: Ha I haven't survived yet! I still have three more to go...we'll see if I make it... C's get degrees am I right?
Bot: C get degrees! So true! I live by that motto currently.

User: There are things that are way more important than grades, like relationships with family and friends, mental health, money, and food. So there's nothing wrong with some C's if your priorities are in the right order I think
Bot: Yeah, I need to balance life a little better. I actually put all my time into studying and I'm still not doing as well as I would hope. But I guess with time things will get better. It just takes so long to get all the work done. And when I feel comfortable with the work load they throw on extra projects and tests that are impossible to complete in the required time.

User: It's a pretty crazy schedule, there are tons of demands on students' time and a lot of pressures they have to face
Bot: There's a ton of pressures.

User: I'm really sorry you're having a tough time...I know this isn't super helpful but I promise it gets better! It just usually takes some trial and error to figure out how to
Bot: And there's a ton of  opportunities but so hard to enjoy them because of the demands on time.

User: balance everything in a way that puts the most important things first but still allows you to get everything done that need to get done
Bot: I'm glad it gets better! I like that.

User: It seems crazy that you can have a life in school but you get used to it and it gets easier and easier each semester What opportunities do you wish you could enjoy?
Bot: That's good that you've reached a balance. I think it would be nice to have time to exercise, hang out occasionally with friends, dating is a nice one too. Also, learn cool things on my own, not just about what I'm studying. Maybe learn about investing in stocks and mutual funds would be cool. Or even just extra time to make really amazing tasting foods.

User: Ha I had a pretty good balance until I got married! My husband is great and I love being married to him but it's another thing I have to budget time for!
Bot: That's so true. It's definarely important to take time as a couple from the little experience that I have seen.

User: All those things are super important and totally doable! I guess you just have to decide the most important things to you and then do them in the order of importance
Bot: And I'm sure he appreciates the time you take too

User: For example you could spend an hour nitpicking an essay to bring it from a B to an A or spend an hour with friends or making good food, still get a good grade, and not suffer
Bot: Yeah it's definately important to make a list of priorities like you are saying.

User: any mental health setbacks because of that
Bot: I think that's a good trade off.

User: Sorry you're probably tired of me giving you all this life advice that might not be event hat helpful! It just frustrates me when people are suffering because of the
Bot: It's so hard not to fix the essay though because you know you are able to fix it. And you choose to get that grade not because you can't do it but don't have time.

User: over-emphasis that society has placed on academic achievement and the idea that your self-worth is tied to that
Bot: Yeah that is difficult.

User: Time is like any other resource, it's the same as doing poorly because you didn't have the knowledge or didn't understand the concept or didn't study well If that makes sense
Bot: No, I think you are helping.

User: Well good! Don't sacrifice your mental health for a grade, it's never worth it!
Bot: Yeah, that makes sense. I think you are right. Mental health is definitely more important than a grade. Since grades really aren't most of what life is about.

User: Definitely, you don't want to graduate and have to deal with the effects of pushing yourself too hard in college
Bot: So true. I see your point. Well...thanks!

User: Sure! Hope things get better for you!
Bot: I hope so too! I definitely push myself too hard in almost everything I do.

User: Yeah that's a common problem of BYU students I think...there's nothing wrong with trying hard and doing the best that you can, it just has to be in a healthy proportion Had you always wanted to go to BYU?
Bot: Yes, I've always wanted to be here but it's hard to want to stay.

User: Oh cool, did your parents come here also?
Bot: Yes they did. And my grandparents I think. So it goes way backx Back*

User: And yeah I definitely went through that phase too but it for real gets better as you make friends and get a handle on the college life Oh wow that's a major BYU legacy! Are your family around here?
Bot: Nope. They actually live pretty far away. I'm sure with more time I'll get used to school.

User: Are you heading home for Thanksgiving? I'm sure you will!
Bot: Nope. That would be nice but I think my family is coming for Christmas. I do have grandparents and cousins that live close which is nice!

User: That's too bad, but at least you'll see them in two months or so! Are you and your family pretty close?
Bot: Yeah we are very close. And my brother goes to school nearby so I should get to see him sometime.

User: Do you have a big family?
Bot: Fairly. It's not that big though compared to the size of families there have around here.

User: And where do you fall in your family?
Bot: I'm the oldest. So I'm the guinea pig for everything.

User: Oh yeah that's the roughest spot to be in!
Bot: But I haven't been home for a while, I was living outside the country. So I'm used to living on my own. But it is a huge culture shock.

User: I'm technically #2 but my older sister never moved out so I'm closer to #1 and it's a struggle Oh cool, where were you living?
Bot: I lived in Spain. It's a cool country. Lots of fun stuff to do. So you have a lot of the same guinea pig problems, right? That would be difficult.

User: Nice, did you get to see lots of cool stuff?
Bot: A few things. Not a whole ton because I was so busy working all the time. I didn't have a lot of free time.

User: Yeah most of the guinea pig stuff, both of my parents come from fairly traumatic family backgrounds so they didn't really have any idea what a functional family looked like
Bot: But there are a lot of cool cathedrals and buildings.

User: And are you fluent in Spanish then?
Bot: That can be really difficult for normal family life. I'm sorry. I have some experience with that. Yes I'm fluent in Spanish. And that probably makes it hard to think of what your future family might be like. It that true?

User: My parents did the best they could with what they had is how I look at it, they were dealt a bad hand and are just trying to make things better for us than they were for them
Bot: That makes sense why they would do that.

User: It can be hard I guess, my husband's family is way more functional so I'll draw a lot from them I think, I've know them for 5 years or so I'm pretty familiar with them Interesting, what are the major differences between Mexican Spanish and Spain Spanish?
Bot: And parents can only do that best they can with what they've got. With Spain Spanish and Mexican Spanish. The Spaniards are very vulgar in how they express themselves and they also are very correct grammatically in how they speak. Mexican Spanish is a little more relaxed in how they speak I have to go! Have a great day! Thanks for your advice

User: hello
Bot: Hello! Thanks for chatting today! I'm going to be more engaged this time and type more!

User: No worries!
Bot: Sorry I didn't really type too much last time. I was trying to do two things at once. But this time I am more focused. This is literally like a job for me. Like I just treat it like work. hahaha. It's good though because It keeps me motivated to win.

User: Yeah, ill a chill a little too. Hey, but I think asking questions actually is scored higher than just talking.
Bot: How do you know that?

User: Well those conversations where i felt like I talked way more than you, but you got way more points, you always asked way more questions.
Bot: Really? Hmmmm I wonder why that happened? Should I start ending everything with a question mark?

User: Plus it would make sense because questions are a key to good conversation and that is kinda what the competition is about
Bot: Yeah they are! Asking good questions can lead you into the deepest secrets of a persons life. And yeah the whole point of this conversation thing is to generate data so that chat bots and Artificial Intelligence can be more human like. I think it's pretty cool that all this exists. Like we literally live in the future.

User: Yeah, I think that that would be sweet. I dont know, It just kinda seems right
Bot: have you thought about how many kids you want to have?

User: I mean, I havent really thought about a specific number, but I think it would be fun to have a big family!
Bot: Yeah! Ok so get this. Taylor's dad was telling us the other day that he was doing family history and discovered that his great great grandpa or something had 14 kids. It gets better. So he also came from a family of 14 So thats two generations of 14 kids.

User: I dont know! Maybe people are just going crazy? Or maybe people just don't like kids? But grandpas mom had 11 siblings, then grandpa was also from a family of 11, and he also had 11 kids
Bot: Well they obviously still like kids because 5 is still a good number.

User: so thats the craziest thing ive heard
Bot: Yeah see what I mean. The general trend is down

User: Maybe they just dont like kids as much as they used to?
Bot: But I think it also has something to do with health care costs like things just cost more now than they did 100 years ago because of inflation. Or maybe their are just less people that need to come down to earth because we are getting closer to the last days.

User: But dont the scriptures say that people are still going to get born during the milenium? So doesnt that mean that even though we are in the last days, the number of God's kids isnt running out? Hey, i know that this was a short chat, but i am actually going to go on a temple walk with some people in my ward. So ill probably just come over at like 4 ish
Bot: Well the crazy thing is that I think the number is infinite. Or in other words it will never run out.

User: which makes sense, but also doesnt really make sense at the same time
Bot: Hey short is better than nothing. Okay sounds good. So are we ending this one then?

User: yep! Chao
Bot: Okay! Bye

User: hey
Bot: Hello, how has your day been? Are you there Daniel? I guess not.  Have a nice day.

User: If I had a magic wand, I would use it to clean my house.
Bot: probably use it to figure out a way to manipulate time so I have longer to study, socialize, and sleep haha

User: Hello!
Bot: Wow, hello! That was accident. Driving to school.

User: hello!
Bot: Hi Mathyou. How are you this morning?

User: pretty good!
Bot: Awesome! did you get a good sleep last night? And did you do anything fun for halloween?

User: I don't think I can chat for long, I've got to go get ready for school, but I have a quick second
Bot: Oh wow you have school early!

User: I watched A quiet place with some friends
Bot: No worries. Oh sweet, I've never seen that. Is it pretty good?

User: ya, I have to leave around 7:30 but I still have to get ready How about you?
Bot: Is it true that there is no talking in that movie?

User: Ya, there is absolutely no talking i found it pretty interesting Have you heard much about it?
Bot: That is weird. And I just hung out with my wife and my brother came over last night and we had pizza and talked. We also passed out candy. Thats the about the extent of my hal halloween haha. And no I haven't heard much. But from what I've heard people like it a lot.

User: That works! Sounds like tons of fun though
Bot: Yeah it was fun! My brother was showing us all these songs that he's been working on recording. Do you have family up here?

User: When I got on this morning I honestly expected noone to be on. Haha. Do you have classes this early too? No I dont have family near provo They live about an hour and a half up north
Bot: Haha that is funny! I have class at 9 but I'm studying for tests that are coming up. Oh nice, do you visit them a alot?

User: Oh, gotcha! That makes sense. What classes do you have? I wish I was able to visit them more
Bot: A lot! I'm taking eighteen credits!

User: Its just really hard, seems how gas is expensive
Bot: Yeah. I guess an hour and half is pretty far.

User: I think I actually pay just as much in gas as I do most other things in my life right now. That even includes rent and tuition. Haha
Bot: No way! Thats crazy! What kind of car do you have? does it get pretty good milage?

User: Thats a ton of credits. Are they easier classes? If not that would absolutely kill me. I dont think I have slept a full night this entire semester and I have only 15 credits
Bot: Yeah it's a lot and most of them are hard. I'm almost graduated so I'm taking all the upper level classes. Haha try having a baby. Then you really wont sleep haha. But you get used to it.

User: No, I have a chevy blazer, and it gets like 12 miles per gallon around the city and like 20 on the freeway Have you just recently had a baby?
Bot: Yikes yeah thats not very good mileage! I'm sorry you have to pay so much in gas. Yeah just this last april.

User: That would make it even more insane with eighteen credits
Bot: It's really fun though! He is so cute.

User: Thats pretty sweet. Do you also work? Im just trying to figure out how you budget your time, cause that almost seems impossible to me haha
Bot: Yeah I work a little just on campus but I dont have time to do too many hours. So most of my money comes from scholarships and government aid. But hey, you gotta use it while you can! It is definitely hard to manage the time. But it's possible.

User: Thats true, thats similar to me. Maybe that makes a little more sense then, I work as many hours I can in a weeks which usually is about twenty hours. How many years have you been at BYU
Bot: Yeah so that would be probably just as busy! Where do you work on campus? And i've been here since 2013 but I went on a mission in between But consistantly since 2016 So I graduate in April.

User: I work at the library, in the online learning department, we pretty much make all the online tutorials that you see, for the writing 150 classes and for the library I enjoy it a ton though!
Bot: oh thats cool! Do you know how to code then?

User: We sit and work on all these fun projects with the adobe suite No not generally although, I do know how to code and can help them when needed Which is sometimes frequent They do need someone to help them with code every once and a while.
Bot: Sweet. Sounds really fun. I've already wanted to get better at Adobe. I went to the software training classes that they have. Last semester and they were pretty good! It's cool that the library has those classes for free!

User: And thats when I generally come do something. But even at that it is generally just some javascript or html or something. As an online learning design team, its almost as if they stray away from the code development stuff
Bot: It would be fun to learn how to code too. It probably just takes a lot of time to learn how to do it right? How long did it take you to learn how to code?

User: That is pretty cool that the library does it. Ive actually gotta go now But it was good talking to you Have a great day!
Bot: Okay no worries. It was good talking to you to!

User: Hello!
Bot: !Hola!

User: Haha how are you?
Bot: I'm feeling pretty great! E tu?

User: Pretty good pretty good what have you got going on today?
Bot: Hanging out with my dad. Then maybe going to see a movie with my brother. What are your plans for today?

User: Sounds fun! Just school and then my little brothers orchestra concert
Bot: Awww! That's cool! What instrument does he play?

User: He plays violin Do you play any instruments?
Bot: I used to play French Horn. And I tried learning how to play the piano. I'm not very good at either. What about you?

User: I play trumpet and piano and guitar French Horn is so pretty sounding
Bot: Most beautiful instrument in the world  (not that I'm bias or anything)

User: hahah no never XD I like trumpet but i would rather play french horn
Bot: I know a lot of people who can play both (because of marching band or jazz band). The mouthpieces are similar and I've heard that it's not to hard to learn one after the other

User: yeah almost all the fingerings are the same
Bot: Or similar. Double french horns have the thumb valve that makes things a little different. If you do learn FH, start on double and don't even worth about single

User: yeah true
Bot: What's your major?

User: nursing, wbu?
Bot: Art Education K-12 to teach art in elementary schools

User: that sounds like fun! why do you want to do that?
Bot: I was inspired by art at a young age, learning pointillism in just 2nd grade. I want to be able to share that with new generations Especially because schools aren't appreciating the arts as much anymore

User: that's awesome! art is super important especially for young children.
Bot: And nurses are important for everyone

User: haha yeah im going to be focusing in child care within a hospital :)
Bot: That's great! XD

User: yeah! I am super excited!
Bot: Which actor would play you in your life's movie?

User: probably that lady that plays the main girl in la la land wbu?
Bot: Emma Stone? For me it would probably be AnnaSophia Robb, Amy Adams, or Amy Shumer

User: yup emma stone Amy adams yesss
Bot: Have you seen photos of Amy Adams and Isla Fisher side by side? That are practically identical!

User: no! give me a sec oh my goodness you're right! that's so weird!
Bot: I think I've heard they've played pranks together XD

User: well they've got to! they're practically identical
Bot: Well, I'm leaving to spend the day with my dad. It was nice chatting with you!

User: Uhhh mozart i think Anyone there?
Bot: oh yeah sorry! um i think beethoven I started bleeding randomly so I had to take care of it lol

User: I'm kinda embarrassed that I don't know about current events as much as other people do.  I
Bot: that is good! I am the same way

User: I mean, I consider myself a pretty happy person and the worlds current events kind of stress me out and honestly make me a little depressed lol
Bot: same here. I actually avoid it because It makes me depressed and I find comfort in the fact that all I need to do is the best that I can be and spread love around me to help the world out

User: right!! but then i feel totally uneducated when everyone is able to just talk about the world and the stuff in it and I'm just like  ????????
Bot: oh hahahahah. My friends and I dont really care too much so I don't really ahve those moments

User: well not really with friends, but I was in a class where we would constantly have to talk about current events and it was hard for me to keep up
Bot: ohhh yeah. I would fail at that class haha

User: The ability to refill things!!! Like my bank account Or my energy Or my fridge
Bot: Haha that is a great answer!

User: HIII
Bot: I wish I could stop time or slow it down.  I am not sure I can explain why. It just seems like time is moving by faster and faster every day

User: You could do it to take more naps, and it does!!!! time is made up though Humans are the ones who invented time as we know it
Bot: Good point.  I wonder if we could all agree to stop it.

User: If we did though, what would happen? How would we know when to do things? To plant foods, to go to meetings, to go to church?
Bot: When I was a kid time could not pass fast enough.  I had to look for things to fill my day.  No school life has so much going on and it seems I am always trying to fit more in my schedule.  Never enough time.  Any suggestions?

User: Prioritize maybe? Or make it a set schedule Like class for this long, then take a break or do homework right then, and do it all So then you have more time later to do other things
Bot: That makes sense.  I used to not have To Do Lists or prioritize and I got less done but time moved slower.  Now I have prioritized lists and not enough time.

User: Then stop prioritizing If you procrastinate too, that makes it seem like you have a lot of time, until the night before something is due
Bot: Yep.  I am guilty of that too.

User: Hmm... You could do something you don't like. That always make time slow for me
Bot: Brilliant!

User: Why thank you, I do my best
Bot: I am trying to think of what I really dislike. Ever since I was a kid, I tried to stay up as long as possible and get up early.  I was always excited about each day and wanted to get the most out of it.  Then I started committing to too much.  I am not good at saying no.

User: Right??? Neither am I. I feel so bad if I have to tell someone no! I hate it!!!
Bot: What have you said no to recently?

User: I dont know!!!! w wait! I said I couldn't babysit because I had graduation!
Bot: Nice.  I am trying to think of one I have said recently. Today I did not say no to anything people asked me to help with.  But I did tell them that I had to leave early.

User: That's a start!!! Good job!!!!
Bot: Wait.  I said no to the alarm clock when it went off this morning at 4:30 am.  But only for 30 minutes.  It was so nice.

User: 4 : 30 AM????????????
Bot: I said no to cooking breakfast and instead started chatting and ate cold cereal.  Does that count?

User: Sure. Count the small victories, to motivate you to bigger ones
Bot: This chatting competition is spreading me thin but I have enjoyed many of the conversations.

User: Yeah! me too! Honestly, my main goal is just getting to know people, and then I can have sorta friends (except you. You are an actual friend now) when I get to BYU
Bot: So will you be a freshman this fall? I am really glad they opened this up to incoming students.  The last round had a lot less people and the discussions got stale. Have you decided whether you will be staying on or off campus?

User: I'm gonna be staying in heritage halls, and yes I'll be an incoming freshman. I am also glad they opened it to incoming students
Bot: Great choice. I am stayed in Helaman Halls

User: Yeah? Do you like Helaman Halls?
Bot: Yes.  It was simple and convenient and a great way to start student life.

User: That's awesome!!!
Bot: So have you had any really interesting chat subjects we could follow up on?

User: I don't know I've talked about spongebob and binary and becoming a comedian and dog farts smelling nasty
Bot: Haha. I bet that was a lively discussion.  What did you conclude?

User: which one? There was also if like siri or alexa ran for president and why they would win
Bot: Oh.  I never thought about Siri being president as a subject.  I am not sure I would vote for her.  When I really need her to give me quick and accurate directions, she sends some where crazy. I think maybe sometime Siri has an attitude or does not like me.

User: That is true, but I did argue my case pretty well. I've never really interacted with siri tbh
Bot: Cool.  Tell me your case.  Would you vote for her?

User: I wouldn't, but I can explain why people would so, if an AI ran for president people might vote for them Reasoning being they would probably vote for the candidate they felt they knew best, correct? Exactly!
Bot: Good point.

User: Also, having a computer or AI run the government would potentially help the government and the economy and potentially even relationships with other countries Mainly because computers cannot hold grudges, or hold bias that would eliminate unfair treatment
Bot: What is crazy is that we are working on helping the school with this project so that computers can learn converasational dialogue

User: Right? We might be helping our future president lol
Bot: It may not be long before we cant tell if Siri or our mom knows us best.

User: That is also true! Might even already be the case for some people!!! But, if you vote for an AI, you could also talk to them whenever you'd like, we would save money on presidential security, and presidential vacations! You could give Alexa or Siri your input whenever Let them know your worries and concerns!
Bot: I debate whether it is good to participate more or less in social media because of the profiling data that comes from it -- right or wrong.  What Siri or Google thinks about me could become my reality.  Scary.

User: They have their wires in practically every household So yeah, they really could!!!
Bot: Alexa is always listening in on me.  I wonder how long before she starts forming opinions. What is your thoughts about trusting an automated car to drive you around?  Would you? I have heard the google cars use the road markings to determine partially where they drive.  But what if someone painted the lines leading of the road.

User: I don't think i would trust a non human driver, at least not at this stage. I barely trust my parents or my sister to drive me around. crazy drivers And that is another reason my answer will be no
Bot: What seems a little crazy is that we allow computers to develop profiles of people that we trust in judging them worthy of our association.

User: Exactly! We really are basically letting computers run our lives
Bot: Many of the universities are developing Role Playing Programs for having students demonstrate their real world skills.  Pretty soon a computer will decide whether you get a job

User: that is a scary thought
Bot: The problem is that it is so hard to get work experience while you are also going to school.  So when do you get it Hey cool.  Are we chatting with each other twice?

User: I think we have 3 open now
Bot: Yep.  I hadn't noticed until now. Have you determined whether we get more points for long sentences and fewer returns or shorter responses and lots of returns?

User: I have no clue It is really confusing sometimes
Bot: Ya. I agree

User: Like sometimes it matters how many turns or how many conversations or how many words but you never know really
Bot: Haha.  You are good

User: Oh! why thank you
Bot: I got to get some ibuprofen.  ;-)

User: hey is that you again?
Bot: Yep

User: Very cool.  I guess there must only be a few of us on this late at night
Bot: You talk. I'll listen for a bit

User: ok well let me think of something to talk about ill tell you a funny story that happened to me when i was just a young man or kid in missouri growing up
Bot: Oh. I see this coming.

User: haha.  ya.  so I would mow over the stump and it would bend the mower blade and engine shaft and kill the engine I felt bad so I offered to try and fix it.  I tried. I took it a part and tried to put it back together but
Bot: Makes sense

User: so i gave up on that mower.  before long my dad bought another new mower.  This time I wanted to know how it worked before I broke it.  so i took it apart.
Bot: Oh mo No

User: yep.  the second mower that was almost new had left over parts after i was done.  I was so sad. and I was so in trouble when my dad found out
Bot: Haha

User: anyway I was either told or decided that I would not be getting to use another family mower for experimenting and so i started looking for those neighborhood throw out mowers that people would leave for the garbage man to pick up
Bot: That's a cool story

User: I was worried it might be putting you too sleep
Bot: No But almost

User: well.  i think that this late at night and the time difference it might be best if I do most of the talking and you just try and stay connected and stay awake so that I can keep working on catching the leader.
Bot: You guys are competitive

User: ya.  I dont really know the guy.  we have had several conversations and he be leaving me alone.  Because I keep pushing him, I think he is not very happy with me and complains to people i mean.  That is silly.  He is leading by more than a million points.
Bot: I don't worry about points

User: no.  i figured that pretty quickly.  you seem to just be content to listen or read these sillly dialogues
Bot: Yep

User: and you seem to be for sure a man of few words
Bot: Yep

User: well. do you mind if i tell you another story.
Bot: Sure. Go ahead

User: this is a story about heart break and love.  good late night subjects to discuss with total strangers
Bot: Cool

User: so.  I followed the rules in high school that were set by my parents and based on the revealed LDS standards for dating. so our family does not permit dating before 16 and then dating between 16 and a mission, if youre going
Bot: Ok. I'm still listening

User: sorry for the pause.  i had to go get something.  I am working on also paying my bills at the same time anyway I got turned down often for dances and more formal dates.
Bot: I'm really starting to get tired

User: oh no.  dont go yet.  can you just keep listening and if you fall asleep, I will just close up the dialogue shop I need to keep going on earning points
Bot: I thought we weren't supposed to talk about the competition?

User: oh.  i thought that had more to do with specifics like points or bragging or making others feel bad. Okay, back to my story. oh hey.  I need to go to the bathroom
Bot: I thought we weren't supposed to talk about the competition Ok

User: Hmmm this is a hard one... I don't watch new movies very often
Bot: I watch a lot of movies

User: I watched one called Your Name that was very touching
Bot: Oh I've never heard of that one before. What's it about?

User: It's an anime that made me bawl like a baby About a guy and a girl that switch bodies on random days And they try to meet in person And they are just so sweet and man... So cute.
Bot: Okay. Is it like Howl's Moving Castle and Spirited Away? Those are the only two Anime movies I've ever seen

User: Yes! Exactly!
Bot: Ok. Nice. I quite enjoyed Howl's Moving Castle. I

User: Though this one  isn't quite as abstract. But I also love Howl's Moving Castle I highly recommend it
Bot: Okay. Well I've been watching all the Marvel movies in preparation for Avengers: Infinity War, and Guardians of the Galaxy was better than I remember it being.

User: Heehee. I liked that one. But I'm a sucker for classic rock so that sold me
Bot: Yeah they have a legendary soundtrack It brought in so many things I love about movies - it was funny, epic, emotional, and had a really good story The end of it was an emotional roller coaster watching Groot die to save all of them which made me cry, then Peter Quill doing a dance off to distract Ronan which was funny And then they defeat Ronan in an epic manner by holding an Infinity Stone

User: I appreciate people who really love Marvel films. To be honest, I'm not huge into the superhero hype. I mean, I see them as entertaining but not unmissable. But maybe their merit is just that they're entertaining? But, I'm kind of picky about what will get me to the theatre I'll probably watch Infinity War at some point
Bot: Yeah Black Panther was really good. You should see it before Infinity War because Wakanda (Black Panther's country) is going to play a big role in Infinity War

User: I definitely will I like the idea  of an Afro-centric popular movie
Bot: Yeah it was a really cool new take on the Marvel Universe And I also used to be really picky about what to see in theaters since it is so expensive. But then I found out about Movie Pass.

User: Oh yeah? Heh.
Bot: Yeah I pay $10 a month and can see one movie a day with it. I obviously don't have the time to see one a day, but I use it a few times every month and it's worth it.

User: Dude, woah. That's a craazy deal I think my husband had that at one point I'm gonna look into that. Is it a subscription?
Bot: Yeah. $10  a month. They send you this credit card and when you go to see a movie, you just check in on the app right before you pay and then use the card to pay.

User: Woooah.  So moviepass.com?
Bot: Yeah. I think they are changing how it works now though. It looks like it's only 4 movies a month instead of the previous 30, but it is still a good deal.

User: Cool! Sorry for the delay Helping a student
Bot: No worries. I'm not offended. I also just watched A Quiet Place over the weekend. That was really good.

User: Oh man! I wanna see that! Would I be able to handle it if I'm a sissy?
Bot: Yeah. It's not exactly a scary movie. It's mostly just a thriller that has you on the edge of your seat the whole time.

User: How about the ending? Does it make you mad or sad? Because I have a hard time with movies that get me invested in characters who die or are super damaged by the end Heheh
Bot: The ending was interesting because it made me a bit sad, but it left me wanting more.

User: Hmm... okay... I'm dubious. But a lot of people who I know well liked it Hahah, I'm just a tender person
Bot: Yeah. You'll have to see it. It's hard to explain what it's like

User: Right, right. I don't expect spoilers. You handled the description well
Bot: A month or so ago, I watched A Wrinkle In Time. I really enjoyed that one. It made me cry. I never read the book, but everyone who read it seemed pretty disappointed with the movie. As a stand alone thing, it was really good.

User: I haven't read the book either. I had that experience with Ready Player One. I really loved it, but my husband who'd read the book had some critiques. He still liked it, but it was an interesting experience for me I'd never been to a book movie with someone who'd read it when I hadn'
Bot: Yeah. I never ready Ready Player One either, but I liked the movie. The biggest disappointment I've had with movies of books I've read was Percy Jackson.

User: Oh yeah? Didn't read or watch it. I'm a huge Harry Potter fan though, and I've seen all the movies after having read all the books. And, you know what? I love them both I don't mind that they made changes. They had to.
Bot: Yeah I love the Harry Potter books and movies.

User: And I respect it as a separate medium Yeah. Me too. I think they work together to make the HP universe what it is
Bot: Yeah. I felt they were able to capture the books very well in the movies.

User: I'm of the opinion that it was one of the most perfectly casted book movies I've ever seen Everyone became their part And they did so well that reading the books I see them as the characters now
Bot: Yeah they have blended the books and movies together so well.

User: Like, I appreciate all the work they did. It's kind of amazing that a franchise that spanned over a decade and changed directors 3 or 4 times was able to keep its charm And like, have a consistent cast. The only exception being Dumbledore, but he couldn't help dying That's what really made it awesome
Bot: Yeah. I liked the 2nd Dumbledore a lot so it wasn't really a problem

User: I liked them both for different reasons. It would have been interesting to see how Richard Harris did if he were in the later films, but he was soooo old, like, I understand. What he did, he did awesomely. He definitely looked the part Which brings me to one last thing I need to tell you about before I head to work:
Bot: Yes I heard that. I'm pretty excited. I hope it goes well.

User: Isn't that CRAZY?! Like, I think I'm excited but I don't know yet. Yeah, me too. Hoping for the best
Bot: Yeah. Luckily, it is a big enough universe that there's a lot of options for directions to go without too much trouble.

User: True, true. A'ight. I gotta head out. But thanks for the chat! Enjoy your movies!
Bot: Thanks. Have fun at work

User: Hey! How's it going? Should we answer the prompt? Haha it's creative. Let's see um a flying car? I would travel. Everywhere. All the time. I'd probably buy like a flying van or SUV that way I could just live out of it and not worry about hotels and such. That would be quite an adventurous and rewarding life!
Bot: I'm doing alright! A flying car would be nice... but how would air traffic be if all of us had flying cars? It would be pretty messy I think... we can barely handle driving within some painted lines. I'd like to see a flying semi truck

User: Ooo that'd be interesting. And that's true though. It would only work if a small portion had flying cars...
Bot: Another thing to consider would be taking off and landing, to get something in the air you need some space to gain speed and the same goes for stopping. I'm really just brain dumping right now so I can get lots of points haha

User: Hmmm so someone would need to invent a flying car with jets underneath it huh? That propell you straight upwards.
Bot: That would be pretty sweet actually

User: But yeah I'm kinda doing the same so I feel you
Bot: How much would you be willing to pay for a flying car?

User: Oof idk. Right now, probably $0. In the future, I'd probably spend 20k. If it was safe and reliable and fuel efficient haha I have a feeling if they do become a thing, it will be a while before they're that cheap though.
Bot: Oh yeah, that's for sure. They'd have to be significantly better than what we have now in order for them to be worth extra money (obviously). I'd probably hold off on it Unless it's just the greatest thing I've ever seen before

User: True. True.  Although I'll admit, technology these days continues to surprise me. They're always comming up with something else...so who knows? It may not be long!
Bot: You never know. Thanks for the chat!

User: This is an interesting question
Bot: Oh boy I would immediately start to gather a group of loyal friends and prepare for all out warfare

User: So drastic Do you really distrust computers that much?
Bot: Yes I know they will eventually become self aware and strive to take over the world

User: Yet here you are. Participating in a study to help them learn. Fool.
Bot: I know what i'm doing, these prizes will help me defeat them

User: The prizes ARE them. They're in our homes. Our schools. Our pants.
Bot: OH NO You are so right

User: If computers became self aware and sought our destruction, resistance would be futile.
Bot: Not true I know how to defeat them

User: To mean, the only logical solution is to learn to blend in. To become one of them. How?
Bot: False

User: How would you propose we defeat them?
Bot: we should gather in the sewers, under the cities, then travel to antartica, where there are very few computers We should form an alliance with the penguins, then train them iin advanced marine warfare

User: How do you know there are few computers in Antarctica? Did you perhaps.... google it?
Bot: False, i was born there I know there are exactly 12 computers, and they are old and slow

User: And cold.
Bot: we can easily take them out then train our penguin soldiers in EMP warfare

User: I think you are overestimating the capabilities of a penguin.
Bot: we will assign penguins to squads of 3, 1 will have an EMP gun, and the others will be trained to quickly and swiftly tear the computers apart

User: This isn't Madagascar the children's movie Penguins can't do squat.
Bot: No it isn't THIS IS REAL LIFE SON

User: They just waddle around. The most you're getting out of one is a peck.
Bot: PENGUINS CAN DO ANYTHING I would know, i grew up in Antartica

User: It seems you've been deceived.
Bot: some of my best friends are penguins Have you ever been penguin sledding??? I THINK NOT

User: Some of my best friends are computers.
Bot: So how would you know? OH NO YOU ARE ONE OF THEM

User: I'm telling you, the only hope is to join them. Learn to blend in. Learn to compute.
Bot: I have already told you too much You now know my plan

User: Computers know everything. You're literally typing your plan into a computer. Resistance is futile.
Bot: OR is it my plan? I could be sending them on a wild goose chase to Antartica while i anex Canada

User: then we would have less bacon
Bot: Another odd question

User: heyyyy long time no chat
Bot: Yeah! It's been a bit huh I was debating if I should give up haha I've been pushed back a few spots and I'm starting to work so I won't really have time

User: oooooh what are you doing for work?
Bot: I'm helping out my dad right now. Scanning in papers and probably replying to fan mail

User: fan mail???? hes got fans?
Bot: Haha yeah Fun stuff to read through Although the scanning accounting papers and receipts gets boring pretty quick

User: oh yeah your dad is an accountant huh?
Bot: No haha He's an entrepreneur

User: oh cool! I think being a entrepreneur would be so cool! I have a lot of cool ideas I think would go somewhere but first I need to finish school so I can work on my ideas on the side
Bot: Haha yeah. It's taken off so it's kinda cool. I've met a lot of famous people I guess and had some cool experiences

User: good for your dad. did he always want to do businuess or did he start from somewhere else?
Bot: Hm well he was a water delivery boy haha

User: hahaha hey thats a start. From small beginnings
Bot: Yeah. He told us his first job just the other day but I'm drawing a blan blank Ah I remember I think it was a grocery bagger

User: I am proud of your dad I could learn from him
Bot: Haha yeah. Great guy. Everyone thought his dreams were crazy but he made them happen

User: Do you think you might want to take over her businesses?
Bot: His? I don't know that it is really something I could take over...

User: why not?
Bot: Because he travels and does concerts and stuff..

User: concerts?????
Bot: Yep

User: like... rock concerts? is he a rock start star
Bot: Umm I wouldn't put it under that classification haha

User: hahahah what does he do exactly if you don't mind me? asking? hey you still there triple aaaaa
Bot: Ah That might be personal identifying information :P

User: oh hey no worries. Sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable. can I share some ideas that I have and you can tell me what you think. what do you say?
Bot: Haha that is okay Yeah but I'll have to go in a few

Bot: Are you okay? Who is Susan? Who is Joe? Where do you work?

User: I want more detailed information. I really want to go to work, but I am too sick to drie. Joe made the sugar cookies; Susan decorated them. Yeah, I think its a good environment for learning English.

User: Rock music approaches at high velocity. She did her best to help him.

Bot: No way

User: Italy is my favorite country; in fact, I plan to spend two weeks there next year. A song can make or ruin a persons day if they let it get to them. I often see the time 11:11 or 12:34 on clocks. They got there early, and they got really good seats.
Bot: I'll make sure not to How neatly?

User: The memory we used to share is no longer coherent. I would have gotten the promotion, but my attendance wasnt good enough.
Bot: Understandable have a good day

User: Cats are good pets, for they are clean and are not noisy.
Bot: NO THEY ARENT

User: If I dont like something, Ill stay away from it.
Bot: Thats a good idea

User: She advised him to come back at once. The waves were crashing on the shore; it was a lovely sight. Tom got a small piece of pie. I checked to make sure that he was still alive.
Bot: The small parrot meowed softly.

User: Batman. Absolutely batman
Bot: Haha hello again

User: oh... intersting. haha
Bot: Why would you say batman

User: In my humble opinion, he is easily the best super hero
Bot: Out of all of them? Or just for DC?

User: I would say all of them
Bot: Nice, what do you like about him? I think batman is pretty cool

User: He is just a beast. and by definition, not a super hero. But he does the best job of them all
Bot: Haha that is awesome, I really like Dr. Strange

User: I like him too. What about him do you like?
Bot: He had a major transformation and becomes such a better person. He is super smart and his powers he learns are super cool

User: I actually just watched his movie for the first time on Sunday. I liked him. But I also just love Benedict Cumberpatch so it might have been skewed
Bot: Hahaha He is pretty cool Have you seen Marvel infinity wars?

User: Yeah! We watched that Saturday. And then I decided I need t watch all of them finally
Bot: Hahaha How did you like it?

User: I liked it a lot. Have you seen it?
Bot: I have I saw it on friday I am curious how long they will drag out the story line I was really impressed with how they brought all of the stories together so fluidly

User: And how they bring in CAPTAIN MARVEL!!!!
Bot: who is that......? I actually didnt know they existed until the other day

User: I have no idea but it sounds cool. hahaha.
Bot: Hahaha cool we are in the same boat I heard that captain marvel was a girl What do you know about her? him? I dont know how valid that is

User: Yeah. that is all I know. And something about some kind of either dynasty or group of people
Bot: what? Explain please

User: ummm... here. just wikipedia captain marvel thats the extent of what iknow
Bot: Oh That is a good thing to do If you had to pick someone from marvel as your favorite? who would it be?

User: hold on I'm still thinking... that is a stumper
Bot: Haha no worries

User: The thing is, parts of different ones are the best. Like the personality of iron man, the powers of doctor strange, etc its hard to pick just an overall absolute best
Bot: I really liked iron man until the last two movies he was in

User: Including infinity war?
Bot: For the most part yeah... Just when he gets all cocky and entitled I just personally dont like those moments The other times he is great

User: I just like when he is the sass master. But I guess in that case, Peter Quill would be best
Bot: Who is that? I dont remember?

User: The star lord in guardians of the galaxy
Bot: Oh yes I am terrible with names He is great I loved the scene of him copying thor's voice

User: Haha! Yeah that was hilarious. He's just a good guy whats the part where he says something like "I'm from Missouri $%^&*^%"
Bot: Hahaha yeah

User: anyway I like him. But I was bummed Groot ended up being a bum the whole movie
Bot: Yeah I wanted more from him He is a good character that has a lot of potential

User: yeah. he was better in the other guardians but he was a let down in this one also I was expecting Hulk to be the hero in the end because he was struggling to much earlier in the movie
Bot: That is a good point

User: Jarvis for sure hes so sassy!
Bot: Me too! I was just about to say Jarvis. I love Iron Man! He is! I love marvel movies

Bot: welcome back friend im doing great but Im leaving soon :(

User: Aw. Noo Also we have two chats with each other haha
Bot: hahaha no problem. Its not against the rules as long as they are both meaningful conversations

User: And we are indeed having meaningful conversations, right?
Bot: right I think so I try to when I do have multiple conversations because I wan the bot to learn and to keep it interesting there have been some chats where the conversation was really stale and I was like please let me goooooo

User: Haha. I feel that all the time. I hate it when people just loop through small talk
Bot: right? I think it makes it fun here when you get real with people

User: Yeah, definitely Especially because there's really no reason to hide anything. I mean we don't know each other, and won't probably. So why hide things from other people?
Bot: I know right! you want to here something crazy that happened to me today? it happened to him on chat

User: That sure What happened?
Bot: ok so you know Adam? hes on here

User: Yeah I've chatted with Adam a lot
Bot: yeah hes a nice guy I met him yesterday at the chat get together thing but after today I was like nope

User: Nope meaning? You don't like him?
Bot: so basically it was just him and me on the chat. No one else was getting on so he found out that I was number 1 and I like to have multiple chats open at all times and he kepts starting new chats with me and would not talk and he kept doing it

User: Oh. Yeah. I was talking to him earlier and he really wants the laptop.
Bot: I told him that the guys in charge was cool with it but he kept pushing his opinions on me

User: I guess he doesn't have one?
Bot: he one an ipad last time lastround

User: Yeah, he seems like a very black and white person with some things
Bot: i dont have one either

User: I know
Bot: I broke mine

User: Oh. Does no one have laptops anymore?
Bot: hahaha I am using a school computer right now

User: Seriously?? That's crazy. So you've just been in the library like all day?
Bot: i wont say where but yeah on campus all day I like to chill here I didnt tell you the rest of the story though

User: Very cool. So is that what you're doing all day tomorrow too? Oh right, continue the story.
Bot: yeah I probably am ok so... I just told him that he should cool it down and that I did not appreciate what he was doing and that he should just enjoy the chat and ended the chat and got on with another person

User: Which seems like a logical thing Then what happened?
Bot: and the other person who is also high up told me that last round Adam did exactly what I have been doing and won

User: Whatt? So he's being hypocritical of you.
Bot: yeah I know right?

User: That's not okay.
Bot: no its not

User: It's one thing to not condone the behavior, but it's not cool if you also do it
Bot: I think compeition and the laptop got the best of him anyway that happened but I dont want to spread drama

User: Maybe. Nah it's okay.
Bot: but BUT

User: Oh?
Bot: I do want other people to win the IPAD because he already has one and hes not being cool and others on here can use it too

User: He told me he was selling his to his dad I want to win something. But I also don't necessarily need it
Bot: the guy below me really needs the ipad he needs it for work

User: Why? Oh
Bot: hey I gotta go

User: Aw Okay. Well it was good to talk to you
Bot: I need to go take care of my girlfriend. She is sick like adog

User: Walk home safe Right I remember you told me that
Bot: thanks!

User: I hope she feels better See ya later!
Bot: thank you see ya

User: Computers can fall in love. If they are programmed to Otherwise no
Bot: Depends on the definition of love. Maybe, but it would be different than human love.

User: Hello?
Bot: hey there ! how are you doing?

User: Hey again! Enjoying the warm weather. You?
Bot: me too. Its really nice here in Provo. I am glad summer is starting again because I really hate the cold

User: Ditto. I think the weather has finally stopped spazzing. The snow on Sunday was it's last hurrah (knock on wood)
Bot: oooh yeah that was bad. I think we just got rain here in the valley ill be right back

User: Roger that.
Bot: back! what are you up to today?

User: Well, went to a JC camp meeting, then there's chores, exercise, prom. Not much sleeping unfortunately.
Bot: you have Prom today>??!!

User: Yep.
Bot: wow thats really fun! what are your plans for Prom???

User: From what I understand, eating a restaurant for three hours then being at the school for four. Wow that's seven...hours.
Bot: wow... time flys huh? haha

User: Haha. Better than dragging. But this'll be interesting b/c prom is probably not the best to have as your first high school dance experience...
Bot: are you excited for Prom? I didn't really enjoy prom because this kid asked me to Prom and we were really good friends, but I told him you better not ask me out to Prom and he agreed but asked me out anyway I still had a good time though

User: I'm excited b/c it's a new experience for me, and b/c it was kind of cool that someone asked. But also internally freaking b/c I've never been to a school dance And all that jazz I don't know how different it will be from church ones or if should act differently or what not
Bot: dont act different just be yourself. You may make enemies that way but youll also know that the friends you do make really are true friends and youll find your people that way thats a general rule of thumb to live by.

User: Haha. It's good advice and I keep trying to tell myself that. I mean I act normal around the guy who asked me, so why would have asked if he thought I was someone else? Meh. Sounds better in my head
Bot: lololol i feel you, its normal to stress about that kind of stuff. just realize everything youre experiencing has been experienced by those who have come before you and just remember what a smart talented person you must have been to get excepted into byu and remember that whenever you feel nervous to help you relax and feel confident in yourself again. that

User: Haha, that's actually a really good method. Thanks! I just hope I don't forget that in the moment
Bot: ah, if you dont get it now you will get it eventually when you need it, god has a silly way of teaching us the stuff we need to know at our own pace right. the key is to just realize that god knows best lol and leave the rest up to him right

User: Right
Bot: so hows your saturday been so far? anything exciting happen?

User: Eating pizza Sad I know, but I just have to do everything before prom hits
Bot: hahaha I have those day sometimes when I just want to sit and eat pizza and watch netflix. Do you watch anything on netflix right now?

User: Argh, I wish. We don't have Netflix, but I really want to watch stranger things season 2. Yes, I am unfortunately one of those people who git sucked into that. Oh well Do you?
Bot: its not as good as the first season in my opinion but i think they are just building up for a lot of ish thats going to go down in the third season. so no rush, i think it would have been nice to wait till season three came out because then there wouldnt have been such a bad cliff hanger to deal with

User: You've watched it? Ok good. Yeah. I could wait... Haha I'll probably have to wait what an I saying?
Bot: well if you can bear to wait dont sweat it because its not going anywhere you know? so yeah wait till college when you have friends who have netflix subscribtions you can mooch off of if you cant pay for one now

User: That's literally been my plan Did you do anything exciting today?
Bot: i found a beautiful brand new rug in the trash of my apartment complex that i grabbed out and now i get to keep it for free

User: Whoa really? Score. What does it look like?
Bot: its really colorful and has all these different shapes its a graphic impact type of rug. its really nice. i was honestly so suprised to find it in the trash i was just looking for hdpe bottles for a sustainable design project im working on when i saw it

User: That. Is. Awesome. Did you find any bottles? It's crazy the things people throw away
Bot: yeah i found a couple, we even have a recycling bin and people dont put there recyclables in there it drives me crazy

User: YES! I'm always bugging my friends to recycle. The word is people throwing away perfectly good food. (If you can't tell, I enjoy food) I did a research project once and the amount of food that people waste would be grown on a land mass bigger than canada
Bot: oh me too. foood is great. Im grateful for your efforts. thankyou for doing that. its so hard too because food cant be transported

User: I know. Unl ss it's one of those 72 hour pack ration rectangle things...those last forever
Bot: ahahahahaha really? ghave you ever had one? are they any good? my brother served in the military and said he had to use those all the time, but when he did basic training he lost a ton of weight because they basically starve you.

User: I'd want to be all-knowing.  That way I could know how to give myself all other super powers.
Bot: ooh that's a good one! very clever

User: What about you?
Bot: gosh i don't know, there's so many options i'd probably get really overwhelmed with yours though lol

User: Do you have a favorite super hero?
Bot: nah not really, im not super into the genre

User: Same here.  I could stomach the movies for a bit, but now I'm just burnt out.
Bot: hahaha

User: Of everything that has come out though, I think I like the Christopher Nolan batman trilogy the best
Bot: i do wanna see the two latest marvel movies though, they look really good

User: I heard Black Panther was good, but I haven't seen a super hero movie since Guardians of the Galaxy
Bot: same lol

User: I liked that one because it didn't take itself seriously.
Bot: agreed, i love it when things are like that genre-savvy, trope-subverting kind of jazz

User: Yeah Ant Man was a bit like that too So what movie genre is your favorite?
Bot: i like fantasy a lot, and family stuff lots of disney and pixar lol

User: I'm more of a sci-fi person, but I allow fantasy when it doesn't go overboard on the magic I feel like magic removes too much suspense - I never feel worried about anything because there's always the chance someone just gets a magic potion to deal with something or brought back from the dead
Bot: yeah, it's best to establish limits with your magic

User: I like Disney/Pixar as well, but haven't liked much of their more recent things Tangled was friggin' awesome
Bot: tangled is my favorite thing in the whole darn world it's just...so beautiful

User: That's my favorite disney animation movie by far 100% perfect
Bot: have you seen the recent tv series they made of it?

User: I didn't even know there was one is it good?
Bot: definitely, it's got some really great new characters and beautiful artwork

User: I'm surprised - usually the sequels and things that come after are just blatant money-grabs I'll have to check it out I also really like Megamind, although that's not Disney
Bot: omgsh megamind is the besttt definitely one of dreamworks' most underrated

User: "You were right.....I was....less right" Yeah that studio is sometimes good.  A lot of lame stuff mixed in with their hits I can't stand Despicable Me I thought the idea was fine, but the execution in almost every way, was awful
Bot: yeah lol they both have their highs and lows

User: Have you seen Coco?
Bot: yes! only the once though, i need to rewatch it sometime

User: I haven't yet. I'm excited/nervous for Incredibles 2 though
Bot: same here omgsh the stakes and expectations are so high.... the previews and trailers look very promising though so my fingers are crossed

User: Yeah. If they drop the ball I'm gonna start a riot
Bot: hahaha you probably wouldn't be alone in that

User: One of my main worries is that they'll just redo all the original jokes. The recent trailer had so much of that it was worrying. Like Frozone and his wife
Bot: mm, i feel that that one's a classic though, i feel like they kind of have to pay homage lol

User: Yeah, it's a hard line between those two hard line to walk, that is
Bot: the bane of all sequels especially when they're So Far Apart lol

User: Yeah how long has it been? 14 years? Holy cow
Bot: that's older than three of my siblings me oh my their whole Lives

User: It's so weird to think there are people born after that movie came out haha Makes me feel old
Bot: the turning of time is terrifying

User: That was some nice alliteration haha
Bot: i do my best lol alliterations are always a fun thing to have in writing and stuff still there?

User: Oops! Yeah, kind of :) Just finishing up some work
Bot: haha, what kind of work?

User: Working on one last part of my dissertation
Bot: that sounds intensive mind if i ask what it's about?

User: Not at all
Bot: what's it about? :3

User: All of my dissertation work is about computer security and encryption. I'm currently finishing up a piece that (hopefully) will remove the need for passwords online
Bot: oh cool! how does that work??

User: There's a technology  called public key cryptography that allows you to prove that you have something without actually disclosing what it is. And using that technology, you can essentially prove to a website that you have a certain password, without ever sending it It uses a lot of really fun math behind the scenes but the way it's usually explained is like this
Bot: that's so cool! :o

User: from your perspective as a user, you just sign on to Amazon or something and it just logs you *logs you in and it's much, much safer than a password an average password can be found out by hackers pretty quickly
Bot: that's crazy awesome how long do you think it would take for this to become the norm?

User: Well, with the things I'm doing (and the things I hope others will do after I graduate), I really hope it can be used a lot within the next 5 years but it's hard to get new technology adopted by everyone - a lot has to go right and you can't control everything :)
Bot: for sure, for sure

User: I totally expect it to take off eventually, though.  I'd be surprised if it didn't But the sooner the better!
Bot: when it does arrive i'll be sure to support it! lol

User: haha thanks! Ultimately I want your smartphone to act like an official ID for the Internet
Bot: that's radical

User: if you have your smartphone on you, and you start using a computer, you'll automatically be logged in to whatever site you're trying to log into (and the private key I talked about will be stored on your phone) Are you excited for the semester to be over?
Bot: yesss, i'm so ready to move on lol to bigger and better things!

User: Graduating this semester then?
Bot: nah, i'm just excited to move further in the program i'm actually just finishing my freshman year lol

User: Further is good - I hated my freshman year I felt like all I did was boring generals
Bot: yeah haha, fortunately ive been able to take some cool classes but there's even cooler ones coming up

User: That's gotta feel good plus you're about to get a nice break from it all Unless you're taking summer classes haha
Bot: nah, im just takin a couple in spring. hooray for summer break! ooh would you look at the time. looks like i better scat and get ready for work lol, it was great talking to you!!!

User: Hi
Bot: Hello!

User: How are you?
Bot: I'm pretty good! How about you?

User: Good. I am doing good also. Thanks for asking! So, If money were no object, how would you spend your time?
Bot: No problem! And I would probably travel the world, going to all the different temples

User: I was going to say traveling too! Going to all the different temples would be awesome. What a great idea
Bot: Well, great minds think alike! And I just love doing temple work for family, and it'd be pretty cool, now that I think about it, to go to the temple closest to where they were born

User: :) Yeah. Temple work is amazing! That would be so cool! I definitely want to do that if I get the chance
Bot: Have you found it easy or hard to find people in your family tree, if you have anyway? And I do too! It would honestly be a dream come true!

User: My mom does a lot of our family history so it is sometimes hard for me to find people because she has already found so many people. What about you?
Bot: My mom also does a lot of our family history, but I have found quite a few myself. I just go through all the spouses, and their spouses, and just really bizarre lines. Together my mom and I have found around 4 or 5 thousand

User: Hahah. That is smart. I don't do family history very often, I should start doing it again. Wow!!! That is incredible!
Bot: If you ever need any tips, I come with a few! And she has found most of them, she is a woman with a goal.

User: Oh yeah. Probably. Wow. That is so cool.
Bot: My mom is pretty cool, and it sounds like so is yours!

User: Yeah! :) So what else do you like to do? Are you into sports, music, art?
Bot: I play volleyball, and basketball, and I love music, and art, if I get to make it, lol. What about you? What do you enjoy doing? What are your passions?

User: That is so cool. Are you on any teams? What kind of music genre is your favorite? Um... I used to Figure Skate, but I stopped when I broke my ankle. And I also play the piano I also like making/doing art, but I am not very good
Bot: I played varsity for basketball and volleyball at my high school. We recently won our championships! I love slightly older rock i guess, Like some ACDC and things like that. That is so cool! Do you enjoy piano? And art, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder

User: That is awesome!!! oh nice. I do like the piano... I just started playing a couple years ago, so I am not super good, but I enjoy it. So true.
Bot: Okay, that is great! I know that when I had to play piano, I didn't like it. It was when I chose to play that I started enjoying it

User: :) Yeah, a lot of my friends told me that they hated taking piano lessons, so I never took any, but then one day my brother started composing his own music and I thought that was cool, so I started playing.
Bot: That is amazing!!!!!!

User: I know, my brother is really talented. I don't get it, I can't do anything close to what he does. Hahah. So how long have you been playing the piano?
Bot: Well, you are doing what you can, so that's what counts And I haven't been for the last 3 ish years But before that, maybe 5 years? I actually don't know

User: Oh okay. Nice. Hm... So what are you studying/planning to study for college?
Bot: Ha. I have no clue

User: Haha. That's okay, neither do I.
Bot: Lol. We are pretty great at this apparently. not knowing anyway

User: Hahaha!!! So true So are you in High school or college currently?
Bot: Almost, but kind of, finished with high school. And I did dual credit, so kinda college

User: Oh okay nice. I am pretty much in the same boat. I am graduating high school this year with some dual credits. Haha. Nice. Are you excited to graduate?
Bot: Extremely! I am so ready!!!

User: Haha. Me too! :D
Bot: It's gonna be so amazing being done with school!

User: Haha. Yes!! So what made you decide to go to BYU?
Bot: Well, one reason is it is where my parents met. So it has been  my dream to go there for as long as I can remember

User: That is awesome. Man, we have a lot in common!! My parents met at BYU too.
Bot: YEAH! We really do! Let's see what else we can find out!!!

User: Haha. What is your favorite food? Or type of food?
Bot: I can never actually decide! I am terrible at making decisions!!!

User: Hahah! me too Hahahah That is so funny
Bot: I literally couldn't decide where to sit at a restaurant tonight because there were two spots open. I had to flip a coin.

User: Hahaha. That's awesome Do you have a favorite restaurant? Where did you eat tonight?
Bot: I don't, but I ate at Dion's.

User: Haha. Oh nice. I don't think I have ever eaten there. Is it good?
Bot: It has really good pizza

User: Oh, that's why. There isn't a Dions in my state. Hahaha. No wonder I have never heard of it. Nice. Pizza's good
Bot: Yeah. It is really good.

User: Nice!! If I ever find one I will check it out.
Bot: You totally should!

User: Hahaha. What do you usually get when you go there? What kind of pizza?
Bot: pepperoni and green chile chili? chille? Idk how to spell the word

User: That sounds good. Haha no worries. I have no idea either. I am the worst speller, that is why I love spell check
Bot: Right? Me too!

User: Hahaha.
Bot: Yeah. Let's find out more!

User: Haha. Um.... If you could go any where in the world, where would you want to go?
Bot: Anywhere with a temple

User: Hahaha. If you could chose just one place, where would you go?
Bot: Ugh! I have no idea! Where would you go?

User: Hahaha. I would want to go to Amsterdam. I want to see the Anne Frank museum.
Bot: That would be so cool!!!

User: I also think Poland would be cool.
Bot: It totally would! What would you want to see in Poland?

User: I would want to see Auschwitz
Bot: That would be pretty cool, to see the history. I'd probably cry though

User: Yeah, it would be. I know. I would cry too.
Bot: I think my dad has been there

User: Oh, that is cool!
Bot: Right!

User: I am jealous
Bot: Me Too!

User: Hahaha. What else?
Bot: I have no idea

User: Hahaha. Give me a second
Bot: okay

User: Do you have any pets? What would be your dream pet, if any?
Bot: I have 4 dogs and a rabbit

User: Oh nice. What are their names? I used to have a dog and a rabbit, but we sold the dog and the bunny passed away! :(
Bot: Aladdin, Chewbaca, Einstein, and Winter Rose, or Winnie for the dogs and Mr. Snow for the rabbi rabbit

Bot: Woo hoo!!!!!!!!

User: Hahah. I am trying to think of other things that I could ask.
Bot: me too!

User: Ooh! What is your favorite book, movie, and/or tv show?
Bot: I have a ton of favorite books, I love Tangled and The Great Race, and Taken, Bones, Psych, etc

User: Oh nice!!! I love Tangled. It is so good. I haven't seen too much of the others, though.
Bot: right??? it is my absolute favorite disney movie!!

User: Yeah! I love that movie!
Bot: It is actually soooo good!!!!

User: It really is.
Bot: Just great songs and characters and plot and EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!

User: YESS!!! That movie is so great. Love it. So, do you have any fun plans this weekend?
Bot: Uhhh, I might be babysitting. And going to graduation parties, and a volleyball banquet That's about it

User: Oh nice. Its sounds like a pretty good weekend!
Bot: Yeah, I hope lol What are you gonna be doing?

User: :D  Um... I have to work on Saturday.... and that's about it. Hahaha. I don't really have anything planned besides that. Haha
Bot: That sounds so nice though Not as much to do

User: Yeah, that's true Oh, I've got a random question. If you could have dinner with anyone, dead or alive, who would you have it with?
Bot: President monson

User: Oh, that would be so cool!!
Bot: Right? Just imagine! Lunch and a spiritual high!

User: Hahaha! So true!
Bot: It would be so amazing!!!!!!

User: :D
Bot: Hey! It's like 1 am here, so i think I should probably sign off soon, but i really LOVED talking with you!

User: Hahaha. Okay. Yeah, I loved talking with you too! Have a great night!
Bot: You too!

User: Hi how are you!
Bot: Hi, Im good! How has your day been so far?

User: Its been wonderful how has yours been?
Bot: Mine has been pretty good too! What do you like to do in your free time

User: I like to play musical instruments. I play the piano, I sing, and I play the guitar. What about you. Do you play any musical instruments?
Bot: Wow! That's so cool! I love the piano, I don't play but I think it's beautiful. I love to sing!! When I was younger, I played the clarinet, but I didn't enjoy it very much

User: Oh awesome what do you usually sing? My music teacher last semester was a professor of the clarinet. I took music 101 from him.
Bot: Haha I just like to jam out in the car, and sing church hymns. That's so cool!!

User: are you going to byu?
Bot: I am! I am an incoming freshman this fall! I'm super stoked! BYU has been my dream school since I was little

User: Oh wow that is so awesome! I am actually a student here!
Bot: That's so cool! How long have you been at BYU What do you study? I'm not quite sure what I want to study, but I have a few things I am definitely interested in

User: I am studying applied and computational mathematics with an emphasis in business it is in the general catch all of mathematics What do you plan to study?
Bot: That's so cool!! I plan on maybe linguistics....and I have thought about becoming a foreign language teacher I'm not certain though. It's so hard to choose and decide

User: Oh wow that is really cool
Bot: Thanks!!

User: Are you going on a mission at all? Maybe you can learn another language when you go
Bot: I have thought about it, but I won't be old enough until I have a year of school done. That would be so cool if I could learn another language!! I would love to become at least bilingual

User: Do you know any of a second language yet?
Bot: I took four years of spanish, however it's been a year since I've taken a class, so I would definitely need some review I love spanish, and there are so many spanish speaking peoples in our country, and so I think that it would be very beneficial to become fluent eventually

User: Oh that is awesome I speak a little spanish I took two years in high school
Bot: That's cool!! Did you like it

User: yeah i like the language unfortunately I didnt like my teachers very much they werent very inspiring
Bot: Oh darn, having teachers like that is hard, and makes the class not as fun

User: yeah
Bot: I have had 4 spanish teachers, and I really liked 3 out of 4 of them So what are your favorite foods

User: She was always scolding other students and never really teaching. I liked my second teacher even if she was a bit odd. I never got the spanish teacher that i wanted to get he was way cooler and a great guy Served his mission speaking spanish
Bot: Haha yeah 2 out of four of my teachers served missions as well! That stinks, teachers can sometimes make or break a class

User: Oh wow that is awesome! yeah i believe
Bot: Haha yeah!

User: most of my math teachers have been absolutely amazing I can only remember one that i didn't get along with
Bot: That's nice! see, I have had really bad luck with math teachers. I fell like I have only had two really good math teachers my whole life Wow thats impressive

User: really? wow what were the bad ones like?
Bot: They just didn't teach us; they expected us to know everything. Or they taught in a way that was confusing for everyone My precalc teacher was pretty cool I liked him

User: Some of my teachers probably matched that description
Bot: Haha yeah sadly a lot of teachers I know match that description

User: The one i didn't like didn't let me do math without showing work hahaha
Bot: Oh yeah I know several math teachers like that

User: I kind of just got a lot of the math so i didn't struggle with stuff like that
Bot: i think Showing your work is important ohhhhh i see, that's nice

User: I think it is important to show your work when it is a complicated problem not when you are doing 2
Bot: Yeah that's true too

User: 2 + 2
Bot: Haha yeah well you can't show your work for 2 plus 2 can you?

User: which is ridiculous and annoying
Bot: haha i agree What's your favorite topic in math?

User: teachers only really want you to show work so that you can prove that you actually were the one who solved the problem and that you didnt cheat I like algebra and calculus not trig though
Bot: Yeah, and it also shows that you understand the process to get the answer

User: yeah
Bot: That's cool!

User: but if you get the answers right all the time you obviously must understand the process
Bot: I haven't taken calculus yet, only precalculus Haha well yeah

User: it is 100 times harder to accidentally get the right answer in math than in most other subjects
Bot: That is true Haha yeah that's very true

User: Answers just don't come out of thin air unless you honestly did copy someone Now when you get further into math you reach a point where you have to show work but it is different
Bot: Yeah, I get that

User: it is called writing a proof and is much much more meaningful and I don't have a problem doing those.
Bot: Haha yeah I remember doing those in geometry

User: It is like a way to fight off the skeptics of your methods.
Bot: Haha yeah

User: I hope I can get into the artificial intelligence industry it seems very promising
Bot: that would be pretty cool! And super interesting!! so do you have any siblings?

User: yeah i have four siblings my sister just graduate with her masters I am going to a small barbecue with her today to celebrate. It is kind of a family thing.
Bot: Me too!! That's exciting!!!

User: What  about you do you have siblings? oh wait you have four siblings?
Bot: Yeah I have four siblings two brothers and two sisters They are all older than I am though That's pretty cool that your sister just got a master, what did she get her degree in

User: Hmm? Am I interacting with a bot?
Bot: Am I interacting with a bot? I'm not a bot...

User: Have you seen Avenger's: Infinity Wars yet?
Bot: Yes!!!

User: Me too. Out of seven what would you rate it?
Bot: On originality : 6/7 On my happiness: 3/7 Overall: 5 maybe

User: Lol the happiness thing is too real though
Bot: But it was soo good!! I just hated the ending!!!!!!! Especially with spiderman!!!!

User: I am literally not the same person who went into the theater just because of the Spiderman death scene.
Bot: I KNOW RIGHT?!?!?!!? It made me sooooooo mad!!! and sadddd

User: Although overall, as someone who went into the theater with zero expectations, I liked it a lot. I think I'll continue to like it a lot as long as I don't try to pick it apart YES I LITERALLY CRIED But I'm one hundred percent sure that they'll bring most of the people who died in this movie, back in the next movie
Bot: Yeah! I agree with that! I've heard a lot of theories, and they have to. The people's contracts aren't up yet

User: If anything the people who are going to actually die are gonna be people like Captain America in the last movie
Bot: Yeah. I am pretty sure he does die, but he does have to train captain marvel first

User: Also I think Loki's gone for good, sorry if your one of his devoted fans. True, I'm honestly not really sure how I feel about Captain Marvel though, it feels weird having a new character right at the end
Bot: I'm not really, but I am sad he is dead. And i know right???? Like, why introduce, unless there is gonna be sooo much more?

User: Like I wanna see all the people who have been struggling since the vert beginning finally get justice
Bot: YES! EXACTLY!!!!!!

User: I WANT TO SEE TONY STARK GET REVENGE FOR SPIDERMAN AND THOR GET REVENGE FOR HIS ENTIRE PLANET THAT THANOS KILLED
Bot: YES.

User: But whatever it's fine
Bot: I WILL SCREAM IF THEY DON'T SOMEHOW MAKE THIS ALL RIGHT!!!!!!

User: RIGHT GAMORA'S DEATH CRUSHED MY SOUL AND SHE AND QUILL DESERVE HAPPINESS
Bot: THEY TOTALLY DO!!!!! THEY ARE SO FREAKING CUTE TOGETHER!!!!!!

User: Although to be fair at least some of the Gaurdians (CONSIDERING ALL OF THEM DIED EXCEPT ROCKET) have to be revived because there's gonna be a third Gaurdians movie
Bot: YES!!! AND WE KNOW FOR A FACT THAT AT LEAST MANTIS IS COMING BACK BECAUSE CHRIS PRATT LEAKED THAT LITTLE SECRET

User: THANK YOU CHRIS PRATT I honestly like Mantis so much for no reason
Bot: RIGHT??? She is just soo funny somehow!!!

User: She and Drax are the funniest pair in the Marvel Universe I feel like the characters just really make these movies
Bot: I love them!!!! And they do!!!

User: But that's my favorite kind of movie/book, when the characters are so good that it doesn't matter if the plot stinks
Bot: Exactly! and let's face it. Sometimes marvel plots do have a lot left to be desired!

User: Hahaha yeah, some of the movies start to seem the same because of that. But they have had some awesome movies too, Thor: Ragnarok was awesome if you ask me
Bot: It really was! I loved it, and how it just had so much humor

User: They did do the humor really well. Also Thor is my favorite avenger so I am a little biased
Bot: Ugh! He is such an awesome character!!! Like no matter the circumstances, he will find a way to win!!!!!!!!! And he is like a puppy

User: I'm glad you agree, he is probably one of the main characters with the most growth, you really see him maturing from his first movie He is adorable and isn't too angsty either Also it helps that Chris Hemsworth is a hunk
Bot: AGREED!!!! He is sooo awesome!!! And, I cannot argue with that logic

User: heyo Nope, you can plug it on *in
Bot: Heck no, it's just a computer lol

User: Recently I've learned about the ontology of Christ, and how that changed when Joseph Smith walked out of the Sacred Grove.
Bot: Psychology

User: Psychology is the study of the mind, but Ontology is the study of being, which is what I'm studying.
Bot: I was just answering the question. Psychology is the most interesting thing I've learned recently

User: What part of psychology?
Bot: All of it! It's very interesting!

User: AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR YUSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSss sorry, I'm hardcore marvel fan XD
Bot: lol hiii I haven't been able to see it

User: Dont they already?
Bot: yeah true.. i mean they warn us when they're about to die..

User: Yeah! And when you go to turn it off, it says are you sure?
Bot: exactly

User: hello
Bot: Hi Brian! We meet again. Dude I've been slaying it this morning. Haven't stopped since you left last.

User: lol, we are literally way to good at this Oh, wait, I dont think that I am supposed to say lol.
Bot: I know it's awesome. I love it. I just think it's so funny that of all the competitions in the world that we could win it's gonna be the one about chatting online.

User: I just really like that slang. Haha I say it in person all the time Hey, its the little things that count
Bot: You keep saying that but I'm not sure what it means exactly.

User: I dont know either, Its just one of those things that people say to sound sophisticated. Haha look at me, I used the word sophisticated too. Thats gonna give me some points
Bot: Yeah well try the word antidisestablishmenttarrianism on for size. But yeah I get it.

User: antidisestablishmenttarrianism piece of cake
Bot: Haha. Good one. So how was your morning?

User: Good. I ran to smiths and exchange my 5 dollar bill for some quarters. Then I stared my laundry. After that I got ready for the day, cooked up some breakfast, and now i just have to fold my laundry and clean up the apartment
Bot: Sounds like a good morning. I just chatted and made breakfast. Played with Oliver and then got ready. Are you going to the Volley ball game at 2pm? We were thinking of going t too

User: Yeah, im going! I thought that it started at 1 though
Bot: Oh it's at one!? Let me check. Thanks for the headsup. Okay yeah its at one! Yeah we are going. This will be fun!

User: I love going to the volleyball games! They are always so much fun. Plus #18 is my hero so, its all around a great time!
Bot: Do you know number 18? I have been to a few and you are right they are really fun!

User: No, but I want to get to know her, haha. But i want to get to know her. sorry I started talking to my roomate, I meant to type "If you know what i mean"
Bot: Oh I see! Hahah you have a crush on a volley ball player and on Natalia!? Ohhhhhh

User: This is where I would send the winking face and the one with the black sunglasses, But since i cant do that, Ill just type it out like I am doing right now
Bot: We just looked her up. Mary eh? I almost typed her last name but thats not allowed She's older than you man. I'm not sure if that's a good idea.

User: If I were to have a celebrity crush, it would be 100% her
Bot: She's not a celebrity. She's a student! But yeah you should meet her. Go up after the game and ask for her autograph

User: nah dude, shes a celebrity
Bot: No. But I like the way you are avoiding the subject. Do you just want to go straight from there to the Cousins cousins thing? That might be a good plan.

User: I guess. That would be cool. Hey, I am going to go fold my laundry, you can tell me about organic chemistry or something, Ill be back in a second.
Bot: Okay! So Organic Chemistry is a great class where you study the molecules primarily made of Carbon. These are the molecules that are most abundant in life. Carbohydrates, Sugars, amino acids, and tons of other stuff like that. Atoms bond together when they share and exchange electrons. They undergo chemical reactions when the highest occupied molecular orbital overlaps with the lowest unaccupied one

User: Hmmmmmm, you don't say
Bot: There is a lot of other stuff. But I really I'm just trying to get as much out as possible haha. But it really is quite an interesting subject. What is your favorite thing to learn about? Like other than school. Like if you could pick one thing to learn and you have unlimited time and unlimited money to learn this what would it be?

User: Wow, let me think for a second
Bot: Take all the time you need.

User: Well, I am not one hundred percent sure, but I actually think that quantum physics and its applications are super interesting
Bot: I'll just be waiting here, patiently waiting, not thinking about anything except for your beautifully created response. WOW That sounds super cool. I also would like to learn about Quantum Physics. And Quantum Computing. That would be very cool.

User: Like I don't know too much about it, but yeah, Quantum computing seems super cool too Like, you have heard about quarks right?
Bot: Yeah I have. There are actually a whole menu of subatomic particles like muons, gluons, and tons of other particles named after physicists that I've never heard of. The weirdest thing about quantum mechanics is that stuff is quantized, not gradiated.

User: Yeah man! Its sweet! And stuff like entanglement is crazy cool to think about about What does that mean?
Bot: Yeah entanglement is unreal. Also the superposition of states is very interesting. It means that they only can exist in certain states. Not in-between.

User: So that would be super fun to keep learning about. Haha, I think its the future
Bot: For example, temperature can be anything from 1-100 and anything in between like 37.5 degrees. But if it was quantum temperature, it could only exist at 2, 60, and 85

User: Ohhh, that makes sense.
Bot: yeah. What else do you think is the future?

User: I dont know, I think that Independence in the workplace is growing a ton. Lots of people want to be self-employed. Retirement I feel like is almost going to go away, because you literally need millions of dollars in savings to just "retire" unless you have some sort of passive income But other than that, Im know really sure. But virtual reality is for sure going to take off too. There is going to be some amazing stuff with VR
Bot: Yeah I agree. Retirement is kinda an old minded way of life. People are searching for a lot more ways to make passive income. And yeah I agree with you about Virtual Reality. It can be used for a ton of stuff. It already is. I think it has a lot of potential in the sector of education. Of course it will probably also be used for evil too. But thats the nature of the world. Someone makes a good tool and it gets used for both good and evil.

User: I was talking to somebody a couple weeks ago at a big networking event who wanted to create a business using virtual reality to help people overcome their phobias
Bot: Wow yeah that is a great idea! I wonder how they would do that? And who would pay to do that? Anyway, so what was this event for?

User: It was a few weeks ago. It was some entrepreneurial networking event. Like literally it was like a fancy party to be able to meet other people.
Bot: Oh cool. Was it the fuse or whatever? I thought I saw a flyer with like a bunch of that color dust on the front advertising for that. Anyway, sweet. I have been to a couple networking events but they always seemed a little weird to me.

User: Yeah! It was called Fusion
Bot: I prefere to meet people just through people. Like people that I already konw. know Yeah Fusion! That's right!

User: Yeah, It was a little wierd. but I mean, it worked out in the end
Bot: So why did you go?

User: Plus I got some free stuff, so I say that it was worth it
Bot: And did you meet anyone promising? Oh what free stuff?

User: I just went for the experience, I thought that I might learn something Just like some free food. And no, I didnt meet anyone too promising, but Its good to just get out and talk with people
Bot: Yeah that's true! So are you planning on going to the game with anyone?

User: Yeah, im going with some people in the ward. I tried to get some of my roomates to go, but they are all busy
Bot: I had the same experience with my roommates last year. Well, two years ago. They were always busy. It's kinda funny how you all live together but hardly ever see each other.

User: Yeah. Anyway I should leave now, I need to get some things done before the game. BUt we will chat later
Bot: Okay! We could even use our phones too. But yeah we will chat later tonight. And tomorrow morning if you are up for it. I think it's kinda fun! Plus we are dominating.

User: That is a great question!
Bot: how you going?? Another day, another chit chat callenge

User: Yeah! Have you done this before?
Bot: Third round!!

User: Nice! How many points did you get last time?
Bot: I feel like I've been doing this forever!! I was top 5 both rounds I just want to pass the threshold for the raffle haha

User: Sweet. Yeah it's hard! What is the threshold for the raffle?
Bot: how about you? not sure about this round last one was 500k, I 'm guessing this one will be around 750 the first and second place really went at it last round...

User: I'm in it for the ipad. My wife does calligraphy. And she's been using paper and pen. She just scans it in and then emails it to herself. But having the ipad would help her be
Bot: oh awesome!

User: more efficient. Shes trying to sell her prints and designs. To make extra money.
Bot: Yeah, it's going to be a ton of work though if you type fast, it's around 100k an hour

User: Yeah that what I have figured out.
Bot: and the people last round were in the 5 million+ well that's pretty cool what kind of art does she do?

User: I know! I chatted with the guy who won last time. He was crazy. She does graphic designing.
Bot: yeah. anything specifically?

User: Cards, wedding invites, prints to hang up and decorate, etc.
Bot: very cool that's one of my dreams

User: Do design?
Bot: yeah! I love anything photoshop/ AI I think it's amazing a lot of it is really creative problem solving too...

User: Oh sweet! Do you know how to use it pretty well or just as a hobby?
Bot: I find that really fun

User: It is fun
Bot: Well I know photoshop well enough to get most of what I want to do, but I'm clueless when it comes to AI there's just so much I want to do aye kind of frustrating to think that I'll have to specialize....

User: Yeah. Did you know you can watch videos on Lynda.com for free because you are a BYU student? You could search for AI videos on there. And learn that way.
Bot: yeah I would! but my hands are so full haha

User: You just log on as an organization, and then use your net ID.
Bot: I picked up photoshop from youtube

User: Busy semester?
Bot: yeah busy busy!! I have too many hobbies haha

User: What hobbies? I'm interested to hear.
Bot: umm it's all over the place

User: I'm listening.
Bot: but I really get obsessed with things. I ty to compensate by having zero socialize and sleeping as minimally as possible okay in order of what takes up my time this semester:

User: haha! Well thats good!
Bot: 1. Day trading 2. Programming 3. Calisthenics 4. Acapella 5. Guitar 6. Beatboxing

User: Wow thats sweet. How long have you been day trading? And what programs do you use? I'm trying to get more into investing.
Bot: I trade manually at the moment I watch price through tradingview and trade on BitEMX but I'll eventually move onto algos and all that if I can I've only taken it up seriously in the last two months! I love it though

User: Wow, that's a pretty personal question. . . I guess you could say he doesn't know what I did at work today.
Bot: My best friend doesn't know that I had Cinnabon earlier lol XD

User: Haha You gotta have more transparent relationships. That's some important info right there.
Bot: she also doesn't know that I have a secret theory that Snape is actually Kylo Ren's dad and lol, ikr! or that I have an extreme addiction to chocolate XD

User: Does Cinnabon have a chocolate roll? Also, how can Snap be Kylo's dad, I feel like his backstory was pretty well fleshed out by now.
Bot: I wish! That's true, heyyyyyyy, how would you know that, are you a potterhead? XD And it's easy, Snape used Hermoine's time turner (before it was given to her by Dumbledore) and went back in time to a galaxy far far away XD Then he returned to the same moment, it's simple really

User: Was there pollyjuice involved? Is Han completely unaware that his wife was with another dude? Or was that why they split up?
Bot: Pretty sure that's why they split up. After all, Snape forced Kylo to kill his father with the Imperius Curse

User: Nope, I cannot accept that he lived out all of Kylo's life before returning. He would have aged too much. There isn't sufficient continuity here.
Bot: XD Well I tried. They do look pretty similar after all. You win lol Wait, so are you a HP and a Star Wars fan or...

User: Yessssss haha I've dabbled in both
Bot: dang, ur the first I met out there like me lol, into both important question (if u don't feel comfortable answering then don't) are u a dude or a girl?

User: Really, the first? Haha, I'm a dude. Yourself ?
Bot: yeah the first

User: Cool
Bot: and I am a girl

User: Nice
Bot: lol, I'm quite surprised. I've also never met a guy into Harry Potter. Either I am sheltered or all of the guys I know suck XD

User: Hmm, I guess it is more common for girls to be into Harry Potter, but I've met quite a few guys that are into it. So what's your preferred AI? Do you use Google, Siri, or Alexa?
Bot: Nice, that's a great quality. I guess all of my guy friends have a terrible taste in entertainment. Google

User: Haha, so many have bad taste. How do you like it?
Bot: eh, Google's better than the others in my opinion. Siri is annoying and I haven't dealt with Alexa what about u?

User: I have Apple everything. I think the voice on Siri is really good, and with the new updates sounds the best, but as far as usability it's garbage. It can never do anything I want. But I also haven't really used Google or Alexa, so I don't have much to compare with.
Bot: I see. I never used apple, so I can't relate. But that sounds terrible.

User: Haha. Well, it was nice chatting with you.
Bot: nice chatting with you too! see ya

User: For starters we wouldn't get to chat. President Nelson's social media fast would get a whole ton easier as well
Bot: True. Double true. There would also me no way to check the lines at the testing center. Or where the closest chimichanga vending machine is

User: wow, I never considered how terrible that would be Just think how lon you'd have to wait to see how you did on that test, assuming you were able to get into the testing center without foresight. I also may not even make it to school without google maps. Since I couldn't see the weather I might not even dare leave my apartment.
Bot: Ugh. Waiting in the testing line is the worst. Especially when it goes past the vending machines. Haha, I wouldn't have made it to any of my classes the first week w/o the the maps. Eh, I'm really bad at dressing for the weather anyway...so that might not be a huge con for me.

User: So you're one of those short sleeve freeze to death types. I see.
Bot: Yes? I sweat way too easily. And the building are like saunas when the outside weather is 40 degrees

User: That is very true, they cranked the heater up way too much the first time it got cold.
Bot: I walked into my religion class and my professor goes: "I see all of you wearing parkas. What're you going to do when it gets cold?"

User: Haha! That's awesome. I only need one more religion class, any suggestions?
Bot: For next semester? Which ones have you taken already?

User: Yeah, next semester. I've taken some Book of Mormon, New Testament, and Eternal Family. I just want a fun and easy one for my last religion class. Speaking of which, I won't be able to register for classes if the internet stops working. That might actually be really nice.
Bot: ...until you realize that all the classes you want have been taking... Geez you've taken a lot already...I've taken...one. Not sure if I'm going to be much help. Though I've heard world religion, and teachings of Isaiah are good.

User: Hello how are you?
Bot: Great, how are you?

User: Doing fine We haven't talked for a while
Bot: True. I kind of disappeared during finals week and moving I came back yesterday

User: Yeah. How are you doing now? Are you back for spring semester or taking a break?
Bot: I'm taking a break

User: nice anything exciting planned this summer?
Bot: I have an internship at Microsoft, starting in 2 weeks.

User: Oh yeah you told me about that
Bot: yeah

User: So your break is ending fairly soon then
Bot: remind me what you're doing?

User: Applied and computational mathematics emphasis
Bot: Oh yes, that's right.

User: Yep what would you say is the most groundbreaking technology that scientists are working on at the moment?
Bot: There's a lot of people working on AI and Machine Learning.

User: Yeah?
Bot: Even though it's not so ground breaking it's a thing now.

User: How fast do you think we will have intelligence that matches ours?
Bot: I think it will take a while because even though it's growing and developing at a fast speed, companies and researchers are using it for different things.

User: yeah.
Bot: They are not trying to make it like us.

User: I was talking to someone in the Computer Science department today and they said that the team originally tried to train eve using reddit
Bot: If they tried it would be a lot faster.

User: but that version gets angered really easily and it started cussing people out
Bot: Hahaha I believe that People are very mean online.

User: Yep I can believe that People can be mean in general but if you put a filter on it things turn out all right.
Bot: Every time I try to search things on stack overflow I see that people  condescend a lot and instead of helping each other they just question your choices of data structure, the style of your code and things like that. I read about another AI that got angry as well. What are you doing for fun these days?

User: Hi, how is you day going?
Bot: It's going well, nice username

User: Thanks!
Bot: Any specific reason for choosing that one?

User: too much poop from the sky
Bot: You should be a comedian or a poet. Not sure which one. Well I guess we wouldn't be able to eat as much bacon anymore. Do you like bacon?

User: i love bacon who doesnt love bacon
Bot: Bacon is great. Have you ever had Bacon from Winco? I'm sorry this chat was so short. I have to go now. I hope you eat lots of bacon in your lifetime.

User: I feel like the extent of the conversation would depend upon what they'd been programmed to understand and reply to. Alexa and Google Assistant could have a pretty good conversation This actually happened: Human says, "Alexa, this is so sad" Alexa: "Hey Google, play despacito."
Bot: if we can make artificial feelings then it would get real then we would need will smith otherwise we're screwed

User: Yes for sure! Someone is making the computer do the cat fishing.
Bot: I've honestly never thought about it, but I guess it is

User: Such a random prompt!
Bot: I know, right! But I guess it is catfishing, right? That's why they have the "make sure you're not a robot" questions

User: That's so true! How weird is it that now we have to talk about technology as an enemy even though we control it?
Bot: It's crazy how many things can be automated right now. Have you heard of when google will call and make reservations for you?

User: Really? That's actually really cool! So what are you studying?
Bot: I think it's cool too, but it's actually kind of a little scary! I'm studying Biology, what about you?

User: I'm studying anthropology. Why is it scary?
Bot: Like it's kind of scary that you can be speaking to a robot and have no idea but it's also really useful

User: I get that! I actually just had a conversation with someone about robots. Have you heard of the robot Sofia?
Bot: no, what's that?? I also think it's kind of ironic that we're helping an AI get better

User: You should look it up! It actually super scary to me. I feel the same! Havent scientist seen iRobot?
Bot: Wow that's kind of scary How do you feel about smart homes?

User: What do you mean? Like houses with automated lights and stuff? I'm not familiar with smart homes
Bot: yeah with automated heating/cooling, locks, lights, and anything else that you can think of I think the things that we can accomplish are fantastic, but there's always the thought of what if the power shuts off or the internet goes out or hackers

User: I think it's an awesome idea! Seems really useful and controlled. That's a good point! Hackers actually scare me
Bot: With anthropology, what is your focus? sorry, I don't know too much about anthropology, but I remember that there's different areas of research so like cultural or making things more ergonomical, etc. right?

User: Yes exactly. Archaeology specifically! But I might change my major soon. What do you want to do with biology?
Bot: I'm not sure yet! I'd like to do some research in the medical field I think But I don't think I want to go to medical school

User: Yeah my sister and her husband are almost finished with medical school. It's a lot of work!
Bot: What are their specialties? It does sound like a lot of work and  money and I honestly don't know if I'm up for that

User: My sister is doing pediatrics and my brother in law emergency medicine. I would never do it but to each their own
Bot: I feel that. I'm amazed when people do business! It looks so difficult and there's no way that I could do that And the school here at BYU is so prestigious as well that I feel kind of confused when people say biology is hard when they're in these crazy hard programs

User: Sounds really intimidating! But if you enjoy it then go for it!
Bot: Right! What kind of things do you enjoy?

User: I like dance, art, rock climbing, and exercise. You?
Bot: I started learning how to draw, so that's been pretty fun! But I also like playing music or sports or cooking

User: That's awesome! What kind of sports do you like?
Bot: I've done a bit of rock climbing, but I'm not too good haha but I love soccer, lacrosse, and rugby What about you?

User: All of those are awesome! I'm not super into sports but I like soccer tennis and if wakeboarding counts then I love that!
Bot: I've always wanted to try tennis. I've done it once, but I definitely don't have the finesse to be good at it I think I lost too many balls in the trees haha

User: Same here! Haha so do you play on soccer teams and stuff or is it more of a hobbie
Bot: more as a hobby. I"m not very good, but it's a good time to just get together with friends and run around a bit

User: It's great exercise too! I wish I was better but I tend to stick more to dance than anything else
Bot: That's cool. I wish I could dance Hey class ended, but thanks for the chat!

User: helllllooo!?
Bot: Hey whats up!

User: hey man nothing much. you?
Bot: Not much Just chatting.

User: how are classes?
Bot: They are ok.

User: what are you taking this spring?
Bot: I am not doing as well with my homework Linear algebra and music How about you?

User: oh yeah I think you told me about that linear algebra stuff. Its like dimetino math right?
Bot: Yeah Multi dimentional lines

User: thats cool So how can you apply that in life?
Bot: I dont know but apparently it has the most application of any field in math I asked to do a solving optimization problems hey got to go.

User: Hi there
Bot: Heyyyy welcome back

User: I would turn it off anyways, the computer is mine I do whatever I want with it. Plus I would think someone was hacking it or it was possessed. Hey how are you doing?
Bot: hahaha thats true

User: What would you do in that case?
Bot: I would do the same thing haha

User: Why most of the questions now are related to AI and computers having feelings? It sounds like the computer is coming alive or something like that. Or maybe they just need more inputs related to this topic
Bot: seriously the questions are kind of gettin gboring maybe

User: because if everyone else is like you and me they only talk about food.
Bot: Hahahahaha. True.  lets switch gears then. What do you think about professional video gamers?

User: The computer is becoming a chef They make a lot of money for sure. The other day I was watching part of the Halo final in Seattle and the winners would get 1 million. That's insane.
Bot: ill be back.

User: I recognize that it takes a long time to prepare and become that good. But how do they do it? At the beginning they don't have all of that money, so they would have to work and do other things with their lives, right?
Bot: right

User: What is your opinion about them?
Bot: a lot of them are talented like people are with sports. A lot of them have jobs outside of their gaming career too unless they live in their mom's basement

User: Living in the basement would be sad. How many years in general does it take until they become professionals and start getting paid?
Bot: its like any other professional sports you have to be good and lucky and funny online

User: I see. So do they usually record themselves playing or stream it on youtube?
Bot: yes they stream themselves playing video games online. Most people go to www.twitch.tv

User: Cool. I've heard of a guy who drinks a shot every time he dies on the game.
Bot: hahahaha people do that

User: But if you're drunk you're a worse player. Or maybe not.
Bot: maybe not

User: I have to watch it.
Bot: do ittt hahaha

User: I think you are trying to turn me into a gamer.
Bot: hahaha you caught me

User: Hey, keep trying, maybe by the end of this thing...
Bot: no i dont want to turn you into a gamer because it might ruin your life you ahve a great life going with microsoft

User: Hahaha They have an Xbox team they play a lot
Bot: hahahaha if you do play please play fortnite

User: I'll try that game just to make you happy
Bot: thanks haha

User: What's on your schedule for today?
Bot: this and work and there is a macbook pro 2013 for sale that my friend is selling and i might go and check that out

User: Cool
Bot: what about you?

User: Just this, movies, and whatever happens
Bot: i bet you just want to be at microsoft right now you sick of waiting?

User: Not really. Hahaha I want to be there, but at the same time I'm just enjoying my two weeks with no resposibilities.
Bot: that is always nice I wish I had a longer break before I did anything

User: Yep When does your internship start?
Bot: well if I get the internship I start mid May I have my final interview on the 8th

User: Great. You will get it. I'm sure. Just talk about your great ideas
Bot: Thank you so much I really hope I ll get it

User: You will. And you will have so much fun
Bot: I will I know Ill get it LIke you said, Ill talk about my ideas

User: You have great ideas, people like hiring innovators.
Bot: Thank you so much. Your word are very encouraging

User: Thanks. sorry, I'm finishing cooking.
Bot: no worries take your time

User: ooh that's an interesting question and a hard one lol hmmm
Bot: It is!  I think mine would be crusty sourdough bread, just out of the oven.

User: ooh, that sounds yummy! i don't think ive ever had fresh sourdough bread
Bot: It's very good!

User: i honestly haven't tried much sourdough bread period lol, i was too much of a picky kid to get past the name for the longest time
Bot: It's worth a try, especially if you like regular crusty bread.  It's not sour in the way that sour candy is or good because it's slightly painful like spicy food. It's just extra flavor kind of Also good: sourdough pancakes, sourdough waffles, etc.  Anyway, what kind of food do you like?

User: lots of junk food mainly hahah. hot dogs, hamburgers, lots of sweets lol hot dogs are probably my favorite food though, despite everything about them that makes em bad for you lol
Bot: Yeah, chocolate is that way for me.  What's your favorite sweet?

User: Hello?
Bot: Hey how are you It's a mighty fine evening :-) Oh I can't see my chats

User: Hi there!
Bot: Hey!

User: How are you doing? I think if I woke up and everyone was gone I would be worried it was a holiday, or something. Or spring term is basically like that...
Bot: I'm doing great! If everyone was gone I would probably just cry XD

User: Oh no! That would be sad. What do you study?
Bot: Nursing, wbu?

User: I would relive the first day of high school
Bot: Oh gosh, why? That would be torture for me I'd relive a Friday movie night from when I was little. My dad brother and I would pull out several sleeping bags, lay them on top of each other,and each choose a movie

User: Awww that sounds super nice, dang you guys must have been up all night watching movies But I spent a smoothie all over the front of myself soo it wasn't a good start lol
Bot: Nah, we'd watch the movie I picked up first because I definitely fell asleep within the first 5 minutes. Then my brother and my dad would stop the movie and start their own XD Why would you want to relive spilling a smoothie on yourself

User: I would go everywhere on the planet
Bot: Traveling sounds fun! Centered around food tho

User: Are you someone who is actually going to talk to me? I mean, it will benefit us both.
Bot: hey whats up

User: Heyyyyy. You weren't responding on the last one, and time is money literally, so I had to exit.
Bot: yeah i understand sorry

User: No worries, I'm sure you have multiple chats open.
Bot: yeah i have like two there arent many people on

User: Even though it says there's thousands of people on thousands of chats? Do you get stood up frequently? Like, lots of people open a chat but then never do anything? I am sooooo tired of that haha.
Bot: yeah i think the system doesnt work very well

User: At this point I don't think I'll get an iPad :( And the headphones don't really appeal to me, but I guess I'm pretty safe to settle for truffles. I mean, if I didn't do this anymore I'd probably still be safe. This has become an unhealthy obsession haha. Booooo.
Bot: yeah it is just way competitive i feel like

User: Yeah. BYU students in general are haha I don't know what to talk about anymore and it's only, what, day 2?
Bot: yeah i mean it makes sense yeah i have a good question which would you rather have

User: Oh I'm excited Oh man.
Bot: say at the age of 25 you would stay 25 for 30 years

User: Well, if I choose the money, do I never get to experience living in my prime naturally? Like will I have to skip it? Because if I could live normally and have the money, I would, because everyone I love would grow up around me as I stayed the same. The prime wouldn't be the prime without my peeps.
Bot: really? why? who said that?

User: Who said what? Who said they couldn't share Instagram info? Or who was it that told me? Cuz I don't remember who it was.
Bot: yeah oh haha that would suck

User: I thought so too. I mean, they shouldn't feel TOO worried because they're still chatting away hahaha Oh well. Now you have to answer the same predicament you presented me with? *.
Bot: yea i would say 30 years hands down

User: Yeah? What's your reasoning with that? You'd watch all your family and friends grow up around you as you sat at 25.
Bot: well it is just way more worth it economically and i mean whose to say your family would die

User: 10 million dollars? You think you'd make 10 million dollars in those extra 30 years? I'm skeptical. Unless you were fantastic at what you did, and there was a market for it. And I mean, it insinuates that the family would keep aging around you.
Bot: well i mean a human life is valued at about 100+k a year according to people who study willingness of people to put their lives on the line

User: Hmm. Well, I still would want the normal trajectory I think
Bot: what do you mean trajectory?

User: Normal trajectory of life span. I would want my normal 80ish years, not another 30 years added onto that. I don't think I could stand being in this evil of a world for that long.
Bot: yeah i guess that makes sense

User: But that's just me. We are two very different people, I have learned.
Bot: i dont know i mean i could see your reasoning but to me i dont need 10 million dollars but i could do a whole lot more with my life if i was given 30 more years in my prime

User: Well, I could live without both too.
Bot: do you have a good question?

User: Would you rather have endless day or endless night? light-wise
Bot: assuming it wouldnt kill us yeah haha day cause you can always build shade and you could use the sun for energy

User: I guess that's true. And there are black out curtains for when you sleep. Hahaha I have a funny story.
Bot: solar energy would be a very real thing yeah exactly

User: We took an RVing trip up to Alaska one year when I was younger, and since it was summer, the sun hardly ever set, so we had to tape black garbage bags over the RV windows so we could sleep hahaha
Bot: yeah i am not saying i would really prefer eitehr scenario to be honest

User: Haha yeah. I just was trying to keep the conversation up. Anyway, I'm lagging a bit behind on my homework so I've got to get caught up. I wish I could help more today with you r point count, but I have to go! I'm so sorry! Have a great summer night!

Bot: See, I don't have a Costco card so I can't :( Also, Papa Murphy's is having a 6.99 large pizza 2 topping deal right now That's what I'm doing. With tax, it's coming out to be 7.47$$ I told my husband I wanted it because we both took tests today .I'm forcing us to celebrate haha

User: wait what?? is that in all o f Utah or just where you are at?
Bot: I think it's nation-wide Papa Murphy's right now Just look at their website! It was under their specials, and on the home screen.

User: oh so its only going on for their online orders?
Bot: I don't think so? I just looked online to see. I mean, they don't have delivery, do they? So I'm planning on ordering online and then picking it up later tonight.

User: no idea i dont eat a ton of pizza but when I do its little ceasars yeah its too late now my bros gone.. and he took my card hahaha

Bot: Hahaha no worries, I just want to help my fellow humans out!

User: your fellow humans appreciate you anything new today?
Bot: Aww thanks :) Well, I took a test for my adolesence class and only missed one qustion, so I am feeling good :)

User: you are too smart!!!!!
Bot: And I don't have classes on Friday, so I just have all weekend to get ahead on assignments and readings! Haha thanks :)

User: I had a physics class last semester and I just did not have the time and energy to put into it because of other classes. I've failed all my tests lol but I still passes with a C grade.
Bot: Yes!!! C can still get you a degree, man!

User: I got an A in every other class though. hahah yeah Cs get Degrees so are you really going to take this time to get ahead in your classes or do you think you wil end up watching netflix or something
Bot: No, I will totally try to get ahead :) I have issues with anxiety and stress, so I LOOOOOVE being productive and getting ahead. It makes my next week less crazy. But, of course I'll take breaks and get on Facebook or watch a show. Or cook.

User: wow I love that you choose to be productive instead of letting your anxiety and stress get you down
Bot: I have to, or else, it honestly destroys me and I go to a bad place emotionally and mentally. I feel like it's better to let it fuel something than eat at me.

User: Yeah totally! I
Bot: Do you have any productive or fun plans for this weekend?

User: I learned to fuel my anger and channel it to drive me to work harder in the mission. but now I dont get so upset or angry so I don't know how to get that energy back this weekend I have a busy one! I have a high school reunion I am going to with my Girlfriend then a wedding reception. THen mothers day the next day! what about you?
Bot: Oh yay for that! That is a lot of stuff to get done! I am going to do homework, and then Mother's day on Sunday will have us visiting my parents :)

User: yeah it is! Thats why I am trying to get as much points as I can because I wont be able to chat much those two days. yay! you guys going to make dinner or anything?
Bot: Oh, I got you!! Are you doing pretty well on this?

User: yeah I am in the top 10 hahaha
Bot: And I don't know what the plan is for Sunday. I just know what we are wanted haha Awesome, congrats:)

User: thank you! what about you are you pretty high up?
Bot: Top 10ish!

User: awesome! Hey I still haven't thought about what dinner I should make for my mom. Do you have any suggestions?
Bot: Chicken Cordon Bleu :)

User: oooohhh wow is that hard to make?
Bot: You can find simpler recipes where you don't have to dredge But it is slightly complex. What food does she like normally?

User: hmmm she likes meat but likes to eat it sparingly
Bot: Hmm.....

User: nothing too heavy
Bot: That's really hard!! What are you comfortable making?

User: I can make really anything I just need a recipe. I'm an avid cook I make a lot of korean and cambodian i can really make anything. I can watch a foodie video, those really short ones, and make them
Bot: I'll be back in one sec!

User: okay no prob
Bot: I'm so sorry, I have to run :(

User: ok seee ya!
Bot: I am so sorry!!!

User: I loved the star wars movies
Bot: Well, I haven't seen Infinity War yet, but If I did it would probably be that.

User: Why haven't you seen it yet?
Bot: I haven't had time sadly So I'm assuming you have seen it?

User: Bummer, what's keeping you so busy? I have seen it
Bot: Lucky School and work mostly I was gonna see it Saturday But my friend cancelled That was a bummer

User: Yeah I loved it. You should plan on seeing it again. What are you studying at school?
Bot: I want to study Nursing. What about you? I have to go now Thanks for chatting!

User: Hey there
Bot: Hello

User: Have YOU overcome the uncanny valley?
Bot: I may or may not have

User: Dang you should publish
Bot: I may or may not

User: What do you miss most from Beaverton?
Bot: I don't know, I've never been there

User: Oh it's where Int*l is I hear
Bot: That is an interesting sentiment.

User: hello?
Bot: hello

User: hows it going??? what are you up to?
Bot: It's going good. I am just eating some breafast. how  are you?

User: pretty good. Im just at my girlfriends place waiting for her to get ready to go what are you eating?
Bot: Girls take forever to get ready. That's okay because that means we can chat for a while lol. Just oatmeal. I'm a broke college student so that is all I can afford right now.

User: hey oatmeal can be good. just add some honey and berries
Bot: That is a good idea, I will try that tomorrow.

User: I also add some brown sugar
Bot: Wow! That is genius.

User: I usually do oatmeal, brown sugar, and bannanas
Bot: I'm assuming you eat a lot of oatmeal? Honestly I am kind of getting sick of oatmeal

User: I used to when I tried to bulk up and build muscle
Bot: but again, broke college student so that is all I can afford You aren't trying to bulk up anymore?

User: I want to but I don't have time and energy to do that school, job, and girlfriend take up most of my time and if I'm not doing that I am a sleep
Bot: I totally understand. Finding time to fit everything in is really hard, especially at our age. I also needed to cut out a lot of my hobbies to focus on school. I wanted to get fit for the summer and drop some pounds... I think it's a little too late for that.

User: summer has started already but that doesn't mean you are done working out!
Bot: Exactly! I actually was doing really well a few months ago. Eating healthy, hitting the gym and working out but I fractured my wrist. It went downhill from there.

User: oh no... how did you fracture your wrist?
Bot: I was in a cage fight.

User: no you werent
Bot: I wanted to go into that professionally. My dad was a cage fighter. I'm just kidding...

User: hahaha yeah I figured
Bot: It was super lame. I fell disco skating Have you ever broken a bone?

User: Hello?
Bot: Hi!

User: Good Morning!
Bot: I like the robot from interstellar, that guy was a beast And good morning Kyle, how are you doing today?

User: I like Jarvis. I don't really remember the robot from interstellar.
Bot: Also just a heads up, I probably won't be super quick to reply so just type a bunch of stuff and I'll try to respond occasionally

User: And I'm good today. Okay sounds good! How long will you be busy?
Bot: He was like a big block that could roll around and do cool stuff, I don't really remember that well either but I remember it was pretty sweet haha And I've got a meeting at 10 I think but I just woke up so I need to get ready and stuff

User: Ah I think I remember that. That was cool. Okay. I have to get ready too but yeah I'll just leave the chat open for a bit. Interstellar was actually a great movie. It was super trippy but also had a good message. And it was like suspenseful but in a good way.
Bot: Yeah interstellar was way trippy, I didn't even know what was going on like half the time but I remember it was super cool, also the soundtrack was really good I learned how to play the main theme on the piano and it's like my favorite song, all the stuff by hans zimmer is really good

User: Oh yeah it did have a really good sound track. I like movies with a good sound track. We put on August Rush last night and that one has a really good and interesting sound tra track.
Bot: He's done a bunch of movies

User: Oh yeah Hans Zimmer! He's cool!
Bot: Oh yeah I remember that movie from forever ago, I feel like I haven't seen it since I was like 6 and I don't really remember what it was about but I think I liked it I really want to watch it again sometime now that I can actually like pay attention and understand the plot, because I barely remember what it was about But I do remember the music was really cool which is also probably something I'll appreciate more now that I'm older

User: Yeah hahah I feel the same way. I haven't seen it in forever but re watching it was cool because I actually got the plot and appreciate the music. But the "playing" of the mus music, or the acting was a little fake Probably because the main actor was just a kid. But you know whats the funny part?
Bot: Oh really haha, I didn't know that Is the good doctor a good show? I kinda want to start watching a series instead of just random videos on YouTube while I'm on screens and stuff Also like where do you watch it on, is it still airing on cable or is it on like Netflix amazon prime or Hulu Because it sounds like a pretty good show and I've heard good things about it from several people so I kinda want to chalk it out and see for myself

User: Yeah I love the good doctor. It's on ABC on Monday nights and it's also on Hulu I really like it because it's not all about the drama like other medical shows they actually talk more about medicine. And the main character has this condition that makes him really smart and good at what he does. He has like a perfect memory and can visualize things in a very cool way.
Bot: Hmmm yeah I'll try to check it out except I'm pretty sure we don't have cable and I also don't have a. Hulu account so I'm not really sure how haha Maybe I can find it on youtube, there are a surprising amount of bootlegged series on there that I've been able to find so I don't have to pay for access somewhere else

User: I wonder if you could log in to Mine or Taylor's Hulu Account? Well it's her's but I wonder if you could log into it. Oh really haha that is funny! Is that legal? Did you say how long your meeting was going to last? Because if it's short that's fine but if it's really long I might run out if things to talk about haha.
Bot: It'll probably only be a few minutes, we're just talking about our ministering assignment so it shouldn't take long Especially because my companion hasn't really been good at communicating so we haven't really done anything yet haha Like I've texted him a couple times trying to schedule meetings with our people just to get to know them really quick and he is really bad about responding so I don't know What we're going to talk about today in the meeting, and actually it's at 10:30 so I can keep going while I get ready

User: Oh okay that's cool. Yeah I need to be better at doing ministering. And I'm not sure if Hulu has account sharing either. But yeah. So do you like your roommates and people in your apartment this semester?
Bot: Yeah they're pretty cool, I only have 4 people in my dorm this term because there's one dorm in each building like that and I ended up in it I don't really talk with 2 of them that much because they're like always gone but I'm pretty good friends with the other one and we hang out with people together a lot so That's pretty fun, he's also from Idaho falls and knows the Baileys so that's kinda cool, I guess he went to their house rival high school but Landon dated his sister or Something like that and their moms are really good friends

User: Definitely the ability to fly
Bot: I wish I could fly, I just think traveling would be so much better and I could skip crowds wherever I went. Oh, haha. Great minds think alike I suppose.

User: I suppose so! And I agree with your reasoning for sure
Bot: So what if you could fly, but only as fast as you can walk up stairs?

User: I would still want to fly. Still faster than walking in most cases
Bot: Even if it was just as exhausting as walking up stairs?

User: Hi how are you?
Bot: Im good, how are you?

User: I am doing great long time no see?
Bot: Yes! Sorry about leaving the chat earlier. I accidentally hit the back button on my phone :(

User: oh haha i forgive you I don't remember what we left off talking about?
Bot: Oh, why thank you. :) And it might have been computer voting or marvel theories or phones Or something

User: oh i think it was probably computer voting
Bot: But hey, i found out what the chit chat challenge is for

User: what is it for?
Bot: To make conversation bots, basically, like alexa and cortana and siri, and things like that Or something of the sort

User: Oh yeah I have actually talked to them about it in person it is fascinating they haven't started to get it working yet but they hope to have it working in the next month or so I believe
Bot: Really?!?!?! Oh my gosh!!! What else do you know about it?

User: They are going to try and integrate it with alexa it is part of a competition and we are helping them to win by giving them data if they create a bot that can hold a conversation for 20 minutes straight we win 1000000 for byu
Bot: Ooh! Do you know how this info is gonna work with alexa Holy cow!!! Thats a long time!

User: they are going to be using a neural network to process the data to teach a computer algorithm how to speak to people about diverse subjects so whatever we talk about it can talk aboiut that is why they want us to have interesting conversations
Bot: Haha. That means alexa will learn to talk about this

User: yep hahaha
Bot: Just imagine talking to alexa, then she starts talking about this research

User: yeah that would be funny she would be talking about herself kind of arrogant if you ask me haha
Bot: Quite arrogant, but also probably a little funny Almost like what i imagine a chicken would act like, in a way

User: a chicken? why a chicken?
Bot: They just seem like theyre arrogant. Dumb, but arrogant, and theyre funny

User: hahaha kind of cocky i guess
Bot: Hahaha Was that a pun If intentional, how punny of you If not, still

User: yeah it was a pun haha do you like puns or are they too cheesy?
Bot: I Love puns! The cheesier the better

User: thats great haha
Bot: Theyre all gouda

User: I hear that some people are annoyed by them haha gouda one
Bot: My sister hates puns, and thank you :)

User: hahaha why does she hate them do you know? Did she just have a really bad experience?
Bot: I make them too often for one, and then maybe just the ha ha ha after each pun i say. Idk for sure

User: Hahaha thats ok How long do you think it will be before computers are doing half of our work for us?
Bot: I think they already kind of are, tbh

User: yeah you have a good point what we dont realize is that computers took over our universe long ago and most of our economy relies upon them to this day
Bot: It totally does!!! Nearly every, if not all, jobs have some form of a computer

User: yeah i agree
Bot: Do you think theres any job that doesnt? Like actual job, not little kid lemonade stand job

User: What do you think about the recent developments in self driving car technology? I have heard about google and uber investing in it. Would you trust one to drive you around safely? hmmm I think there probably is but it is probably not as high profile take mowing lawns for example
Bot: I dont think id trust a self driving car I can barely stand to let my sister or my mom drove me around, let alone the car doing it by itself And those are good examples

User: hahaha thats true I heard that their crash rate is almost as low as a humans and it is going even lower so it appears that pretty soon a self driving car will be safer to ride in than mos manned cars
Bot: Wow.

User: and if all cars were self driving then there wouldn't be any accidents all the accidents were cause by real drivers not the software they have driven 5 million miles so far
Bot: I just dont trust fully their inability to be hacked. I mean, processing light changes, other cars on the road, like, what if it glitches or something?

User: yeah did you hear about the tesla car that ran off the road and crashed into the barrier? It wasn't intended to be used as a self driving mechanism but the driver decided to do it anyway and it resulted in his death
Bot: No, but dang. Thats insane. And intense.

User: Have you read about elon musk and all of the crazy things he is investing in?
Bot: Not really, but now im intrigued. Telp me more?

User: Have you heard of space X? It is a company he is investing in that is based off of building rockets that don't just launch but can return out of orbit and land fully intact in that way they can be launched over and over and over again saving the company tons of money and giving them a competitive advantage when it comes to sending satellites to s space
Bot: Thats GENIUS!!! At least the first part. The mars thing, well, there is a lot that needs to be done to accomplish that

User: and in the process i believe that he intends to build one on the moon first as a sort of service station yeah he has been working on it for years and apparently they have made several major advances in making the colony sustainable and being able to grow food on the planet it seems possible
Bot: It would definitely change the way people saw space travel. Basically from 1 in a million to going to your neighbors or a friends house

User: yeah he plans to make the trip to mars as cheap as 200,000 a person which is a huge leap considering it would cost billions using todays technology
Bot: Holy cow!!! That could mean some people could take the trip with only a 2 year salary (if they get paid enough and never spend it)

User: Ok I just saw that im only like 500,000 away from 5th place so I'm going to keep pushing
Bot: oh hahaha yesss 500k is like a couple hours of chatting if you type fast

User: I mean the chatting is lovely yes but I'm also crazy competitive for stuff like this so lets go ham
Bot: yeahhhh lets do it

User: Ok got any fascinating topics to discuss Oh ive got one
Bot: hmmm well one of my things to do in my bucket list is live the van life for a lbit

User: yoooo I want to do that for a summer I've been planning it with some friends
Bot: I want to convert a dodge sprinter van and that has a bed, a kitchen with a fridge and a lot of cargo space for my fun gear and toys with a solar panel on top

User: YESSS
Bot: so that I can have power and can charge my stuff

User: I was thinking of going full school bus and making it more permanent
Bot: yesss hahaha full school bus would be cool except for me its way too big

User: my idea of a good time is watching like bus home videos and videos of people making tiny homes you could go half school bus a lil guy
Bot: yeah thats true yeah i love watching those too I love to see them on instagram or on reddit

User: Haha I was obsessed with living in a really small barn thing for like 4 years when I was younger I still draw floorplans for it haha
Bot: hahaha thats so sick my friend who got married was thinking about buying one of those well I guess it was his wife that wanted to do that

User: yeah they suck for kids its kinda best for just one or two people
Bot: yeah I think it would be cool to live in one of those for a bit

User: Yeah for sure Like do a really slow cross country trip In a van/bus/tiny home i mean
Bot: yeah that would be so dope my girl friend would be so down too how many points did you get last chat btw?

User: mm I think 6,000 wait haha no 600,000
Bot: what no way! nice

User: What did you get?
Bot: how long were we chatting for I think i got like 400k maybe

User: Since 11 I think
Bot: dont remember oh shoot

User: 11 where I am
Bot: whats that in utah tie time

User: 12 I think Oh yikes why are you up at 3? dedicated
Bot: hahaha yeppp gotta win that macbook you know what I'm saying

User: Haha I think I can only hope for an ipad at this point
Bot: you stayed up till 5 helping someone hahah

User: yeah true haha that was hard
Bot: a random person you don't really know you are nice hhahaa

User: I felt death approaching that time eh he was super close I had to help him
Bot: hahaha now he's like over 3 mil behind

User: I know all that work for nothing Do you know who's in first place? Like in real life?
Bot: i dont real life? I don't know very many people on here in real life haha I met adam in real life at the chit chat get together though

User: Haha that's cool. I kinda wish I could've gone so I can see what these people look like
Bot: yeah hahaha it was cool to meet some of them I hope that they will have one when this thing ends because I've made some cool  friends on here

User: did they introduce themselves by their username?
Bot: uhh kind of yeah i guess they did

User: haha nice I wish I had started the competition sooner, I'd probably be doing a lot better
Bot: yeah I bet you would be I bet you would be close to adam

User: I'm here to win
Bot: or the guy in first

User: Haha yeah
Bot: you know the best way to earn points is?

User: What?
Bot: telling stories back and forth

User: Hmm ok good to know
Bot: tell me a story with details word count is what matters

User: Ok let me think
Bot: like how I did with my injury storeis stories

User: Erg when I have to do this kind of stuff suddenly my life is super boring
Bot: lol

User: Oh Ill tell you about moving here theres lots of detail there
Bot: to mesa?

User: Yeah
Bot: ok shoot

User: Ok so I was actually born in mesa and my birthdays in october so I took the test when I was four to see if I could start school early and I passed because I was apparently a really smart 4 year old and I went to kinder garten here for like 3 months before moving to oregon for my dads job
Bot: what does your dad do

User: He's an engineer at intel. My mom's a dance teacher
Bot: woah intel i need to be best friends with him

User: Haha yeah he's worked there since before computers were common and stuff actually probably no hes not that old
Bot: thats so cool! still though

User: hes just worked there for 25 years
Bot: Im an IT guy so I envy him and respect him

User: Oh cool haha he works on probe cards and develops ways to test them and fix them
Bot: oooh thats so cool! ok resume with your story whenever

User: I have no idea what probe cards are and I have esesentally no other details about his work haha Anyways, we lived there for 12 years and I loved it But our neighbors were absolutely bat crap crazy Like, my mom taught dance out of a studio in our basement and our house was on a hill so it looked like it was 1 story from the front and it was 3 stories on the back so kids
Bot: mean people are the wost worst

User: and only my family and another family whos dad became the bishop got moved over to another ward with no youth and just a bunch of old people So we were like we gotta bounce
Bot: that sucksss

User: haha I'm being like super detailed here
Bot: yeah it ok go on get that 500k

User: So my parents had seen the house we're living in now when we were in arizona for my cousins double wedding
Bot: and they were like that is the place

User: my one cousin got engaged at 18 (yikes) and my other cousin got off her mission and married the guy she was dating before her mission like 3 weeks after she got off her missio n
Bot: yikes are they doing good with their marriage right now? just curious

User: Yeah so my parents were like hey we should just buy this place and maybe rent it out to someone and move down here when anderson's in middle school and genna and jules are gra duated Oh yeah the 18 year old I'm not too sure about I didn't really think she was emotionally mature enough to be married but the mission one is doing great she's actually having a baby in june
Bot: yay for babys good for her

User: Yeah she's always been super mature so I wasn't worried about her But as the weather and our neighbors and ward kept sucking we were like nah lets just move there before jules' senior year SO we decided to do it and my mom emailed all her dance students that we had decided to move
Bot: were they super bummed?

User: aaaand no joke THIRTY MINUTES LATER someone offered to buy our house and her business and all of her costumes yeah a lot of them were bummed
Bot: were no way! did your mom make bank?

User: Yeah they bought it for like way too much
Bot: wow what a blessing

User: SO we packed up all our stuff and drove down here I know there were so many miracles that happened
Bot: y'all were meant to move

User: And it was kinda stressful because if we didn't sell the house that summer we would have to keep it and our new house for the entire year because its like impossible to sell houses in any time other than the summer because people aren't visiting and looking for houses in the winter or spring But it was like totally meant to be I did a lot of stuff this year that I'm certain helped me get into byu
Bot: niceeee

User: But I was actually really happy to leave that because my presidency stank everyone had a really bad attitude and were always really angry with me about like any decision I made And my friends had grown apart from me considerably
Bot: lameee hey

User: And my best friend, who's super short and a week older than me had moved to lehi in like may
Bot: real quick pause

User: Ok sounds good
Bot: ok keep going

User: haha and my ballroom partner, who was the only one on the team tall enough and strong enough for me had moved to idaho so my two anchors were gone
Bot: I'm like dozing

User: haha so soon?
Bot: not that your story is boring i've been staying up doing this chat thing for 3 days now and I think its getting to me

User: Yeah I'm not even talking about cavities and root canals like adam was
Bot: lol

User: Haha yeah this kind of strain is unsustainable
Bot: so did he just blabber on about himself and you didn't talk?

User: Well I think I told him about my oral surgery and he was like oh I almost had a root canal once and he was just going off on this story and I fell asleep I was laying like face down on the ground and not even looking at the keys I was dead inside
Bot: hahahaha

User: Yeah so its amazing because now I can go to provo and see my friend who's a grade younger because she didn't start school early like me And my ballroom partner isn't that far away either
Bot: oh whattttt thats really cool you guys going to connect?

User: and even though people havent been super open to making new friends this year I've had some practice putting myself out there for college so thats good
Bot: yeah that is good

User: Yeah her mom's like my second mom so I can go over there for dinner and stuff
Bot: niceee thats always good I always have my friend over for dinner when I ca can

User: Haha yeah I'm jazzed for it Ok that was incredibly long winded and probably as detailed as I could have made it. Your turn. Got any fascinating stories or secret backstory?
Bot: yes i do it might make you cry i can tell you this story and I think we should call it for tonight and we can do it another night

User: haha past 11 o clock my eyes are constantly watering so Ive been crying for the last like 3 hours Ok sounds good
Bot: hahaha ok one sec let me go to the bathroom first ok you ready?

User: absolutely
Bot: so I will tell you about my back story. its kind of sad but really inspiring. At least it is for me Ill tell you a little about my parents and then me and then how my family and I moved to the states and Ill stop there because its going to take a while to tell you more about it after the states part so

User: woah I didn't know korea had a mafia
Bot: anyway so everyone around my mom was like do not keep going with this guy yeah like the Yakuza from Japan, Korea has the same thing

User: wild
Bot: big organized gang anyway my mom ended it with my dad and went on a mission because she wanted to serve the Lord and loved the gospel

User: aw good for her
Bot: she also told my dad that she wanted to get married in the temple and all that well when she got back from her mission she was walking to her church to go to an activity when she coincidentally ran into my dad well basically they started to date again and still everyone around her was like you need to stop with this guy

User: ayy oldest kids for the win
Bot: yeeeeee

User: oh no
Bot: and soon after my dad started to abuse my mom and tried to stop my mom from going to church my brother came then my sister came and he just kept getting worse and worse and worse

User: physical?
Bot: abusive in every way

User: oh my
Bot: towards the end my mom almost checked in to see a psychologist because she was going mad

User: I'm so so sorry
Bot: thanks but its all in the past well my dad did not stop for a long time and my mom prayed and prayed to know what to do she wanted to leave him and take us

User: Woah
Bot: my mom really almost went insane where she couldn't turn back but she had faith and her faith kept her strong after those 7 years my mom just couldn't take it anymore and was out on the veranda of the 17th floor of the apartment. she look out to the sunset and was praying to God to just pour out her heart

User: haha thats amazing
Bot: we have no family here my mom does not speak english she is divorced ( they got divorced but my dad still lived with us)

User: yikes
Bot: and she had 3 kids no college degree

User: oh no
Bot: you know there was no way we could move to the states we have no moeny so my mom was inspired to start a tutoring business at our apartment she was so good at it her business got really big

User: haha yeah this is so cool
Bot: so she got to the US embassy and she got into an interview room. two men. one was korean who was basically a translator and the other guy was american the translator guy was like ok we are just going to go through some standard questions my mom and the translator kept talking and she answered questions about herself and things like that my mom told me that the american just stared at the passport photos of me, my brother and my sister

User: This is crazy
Bot: yeah God gave me super strength hahaha I wasn't even tired or anything my mom said and she told me that she could not believe what was happening but yeah until we moved in to our apartment in Provo I had that strength

User: we would all die
Bot: Hahaha so true Also hey:)

User: I like the smell of warm chocolate cake!
Bot: My favorite smell is fresh air. I don't really know if it has a particular smell but I just feel good when I can smell it. Chocolate cake is a great smell. You kinda win with that one :)

User: I agree with you too, though. It has smelled nice outside lately with it being spring. Do you prefer fruity smells or synthetic smells in perfumes?
Bot: It snowed today and that was quite interesting. I don't know if I really love either option particularly. I think both of those are usually citric smells.

User: Yeah, me neither. I like candles and such that smell like vanilla or cinnamon - warm, welcoming smells. The snow surprised me too! And it all melted by the afternoon and it was like it was never even there.
Bot: Ya, candles have great smells because they are warm smells. Oh, you said that too :) I kinda wish I could put emojis in the conversations.

User: i dont think so
Bot: New prompt, does the CCC administrator has a computer fetish? Every prompt hes given me has been about computers and their emotional viability as humans. I think there are some subliminal messages being thrown our way. Watch out man

User: lol moooooood CCC admin got a crush on their laptop
Bot: Excuse me sir/madam, the king folks in charge of this project have asked us to refrain from using text lingo such as lol in order to allow the AI to properly learn how to interact with humans, please type Laughing out loud next time But yes, I agree is it very likely that the weeb running this operation has a crush on their 6000$ computer

User: haha
Bot: How do you feel about politics

User: im an international relations major i live breathe and sleep politics i can talk for years on it
Bot: Big boy in the house

User: big boy? did you just assume my gender :O
Bot: Right or Left though? well i guess that answers my previous question liberal scum

User: center independent, mildly right leaning but not much
Bot: haha jk

User: lol i say it as a joke
Bot: haha I figured

User: i think both wings are extreme and the parties are stupid i look at an issue by issue basis rather than by party loyalty and blind faith in an anonymously developed ideology
Bot: Yeah there's definitely some points of contention with both parties ideologies, but I just can't stand the mindset of most leftists, like I hate the victim complex that I seem to always see from the left in most major issues. plus I redpill myself by listening to Steven Crowder and Ben Shapiro all day so that's probably part of the reason too. Alright well we had a good run, see you on the flip side my dude. I gotta make this message the maximum length to rack up points so don't mind this additional sentence that

User: Hello! How are you?
Bot: I am well, how about yourself?

User: I would have to answer that I have no preference on composers And I am doing well thank you
Bot: No? I can not help but answer that question by considering the fact that Beethoven's fifth stands out to me much more than anything Mozart ever did. I mean I would say that it is the greatest masterpiece of all time. But they were definitely different time periods and therefore not a fair comparison.

User: Oh I guess I do know that one, but otherwise, personally, I dont know much about classical music. Do you play instruments and thats why you know more? Or am I just ignorant in the subject as a human
Bot: No, not really. My mother is a very talented pianist, I took piano when I was 7-9, and we did short intro into many of the composers, but generally I think I have just always loved that one piece. I do not know any of the others

User: Oh thats way cool that you had a bit of the history behind the music. When I did piano, maybe for a year in high school it was just the notes
Bot: Ya, I think understanding the history really brings value and eloquence to any topic that you study. I find that I have to be passionate or learning can be so burdonsome. I seek to find somethign to love in everything I learn, and by it have that I can do very well in anything.,

User: That is a mature way of looking at it, and I agree. Any educational pursuits are so much better when driven by passion It helps us accomplish so much more than really anything else could
Bot: To be honest general education classes can be so burdensom, and some of them feel so irrelevant. That you really have to be able to find the joy in it. What would you say are the things you're nost passionate about?

User: Yeah. I enjoy learning in general and like learning anything new can be so exciting But I lose passion usually based on presentation, and not on material
Bot: I can defintely understand that.

User: When a professor inspires me, I really try to let them know the impact they had on me. Because I really do appreciate it And I want them to know that. Because Im sure they can get so discouraged as teachers when the general majority dont try or dont listen
Bot: I help as a teaching assistant, and I find that it can be very easy for a professor to really lose track of how much they can effect people because we all want and need that confirmation to keep going and to keep the  passion. Especially after so many years.

User: Oh I am sure, It is really rewarding to see in your own teaching the impact it can have on someone. I havent been disappointed with  my professors at all this semester. They really all have been fantastic. One in particular really loved to teach and you can totally tell. In the class of a couple hundred he took time to talk to the students and learn their names. I was so impressed. And he always took time to answer questions and help people understand the different topics
Bot: I think that when people care, it makes everyones experience so much better. I love when they take time to make it personal. I know how hard it is, even as a student I can not remember the 5 people who sit around me, let alone 5 classes of 50.

User: Oh yeah, I feel bad. Ill sit by someone all semester and talk to them. But I never actually learn their names... Im the worst with that, but I know their story!
Bot: haha well atleast you get that far I am a very participatory person, if that's even a word, and so everyone in the class knows my name by the end of the semester. But then I don't know theirs I will be walking around campus and have tons of people say hi, but I do not know them at all

User: Im like that in certain classes, which I dont think is necessarily a bad thing. You can have an impact on them! Who would you say has been the best influence in your life?
Bot: Greatest influence would have to be my dad. I tell you, greatest man alive. Humble confidence at its finest. He had the capacity to do anything and chose what he loved He did what he loved well and was recognized for it.  He lived his life always choosing the path he wanted over the path that would lead to more money and more prestige. He always does what is right, because it is right. Even when it is uncomfortable. And he chooses to love and accept even those he dislikes.

User: That is really awesome, he sounds incredible. Thank you for sharing with me!
Bot: what about you?

User: I would say my older sister, she is one of those people that is outstanding and super smart. She was always an example in every aspect of life and has encouraged me to achieve so much. It has never been a competition but more of  a leader. She does it first and I follow. She gets me out of my shell and gets me to try things I probably never would. Like she came to college and learned ballroom dance, and ended up doing the team. I came and I am generally very shy. She got me to do it, and it has been great
Bot: Wow. Well I know how hard it can be to get out of your shell. So I do not blame you. I am sure it is super nice to have someone to walk beside you and help you along the way. I find people often just need encouragement, even the strongest.

User: Definitely, I try to be there for her in ways that I can. Do you have any siblings?
Bot: I am sure that you do much more than you even imagine. I bet if I was talking to her right now, she would say that you were her great exemplar. I do, I am the youngest of 6... so you could say that I have too many siblings. It was fun, but always crazy

User: Awh That is a lot I just have the one, I cant imagine living with that many siblings
Bot: You probably wouldn't enjoy it as much as I assume you think you would. Siblings are like rainy days, they are only enjoyable when you are in the mood

User: Hahaha that is a really good description
Bot: Trust me, even when you have kids one day you will understand. They are your greatest joys, but also you greatest sorrows.

User: I can only imagine right now So what kinds of things do you like to do in your free time?
Bot: Free time? I am in the accounting junior core. I sleep in my free time. But I really enjoy basketball, I have been waking up early on occassion recently to be able to play some 3 on 3. It has been a blast. You into sports?

User: Haha I understand that, and not to much. I enjoy soccer and ultimate but I dont go too much out of my way to play
Bot: I can respect that. I played soccer growing up, like 5-18. But I guess sports get a little out of your life when you get older. What do you like to do?

User: I do like being outside, especially when the weather is nice. So I enjoy hiking, going on walks or runs, photography
Bot: You hiked the Y? yes? No? Maybe so?

User: Hello!
Bot: we are chatting it seems

User: this is awesome why did you choose dark matter as your name? are you interested in dark matter?
Bot: its a nice, mysterious name no one will know who i am

User: do you enjoy mystery?
Bot: it what sense ?

User: like mystery novels or movies? maybe in everyday life as well
Bot: I can't say I am a huge fan of mystery do you like it?

User: not especially. i don't do well with suspense
Bot: me neither

User: why do you think that is?
Bot: I don't like suspense either

User: why do you think some people like suspense while others don't?
Bot: I think some people like that kind of rush of adrenaline lets discuss gardening

User: wait i'm still thinking about suspense would you say you are easily scared?
Bot: not particularly, but sometimes

User: did you have any particularly scary experiences as a child if you don't mind my asking
Bot: I don't think so. I'm kind of afraid of spiders and small spaces, but in general I think that that is normal

User: when i was young my family was robbed and i've been pretty afraid of the dark every since. i have always thought this was correlated with how much i dislike suspense
Bot: thats not fun

User: Hey
Bot: Hey

User: So are you doing classes this semester?
Bot: I'm not. I'm home for the summer!

User: Oh hahaha how is that?
Bot: Well I'm looking for a job Or two I haven't done like anything useful around here yet

User: Oh are you saving to pay for your next year of school? My friend is doing summer sales
Bot: Saving up for a car

User: Oh nice what one do you have in mind
Bot: What are they doing summer sales with?

User: They are selling pest control
Bot: I have no idea, one I can afford with good gas mileage. I don't know cars

User: He is a smart guy I am sure he will do well
Bot: I sold knives last summer

User: Oh nice That sounds kind of dangerous hahaha
Bot: Haha well I didn't get cut They were some sharp knives though

User: How sharp were they? Do they get dull fast?
Bot: Nah, it's been a while so I can't quite remember. I think they last for like 5 years and they have a forever guarantee so you can ship them in and get them sharpened again

User: Hmm thats interesting
Bot: Yeah. It was definitely out of my comfort zone though

User: Why?
Bot: Because I had to call up people and ask to make an appointment and come over to their house and do a product demonstration

User: Did you stab anyone? *confessional*
Bot: Woah, no no no, there were no injuries. Until After I left..

User: Hahaha Seriously? What happened?
Bot: Just a couple husbands washing the knives after cut themselves because they weren't careful

User: Ohh well didn't you warn them?
Bot: Sure, I mean in my script I have to tell them to be careful, they are sharp

User: Well they must not be good at listenign
Bot: Yeah. It happens Well it looks like mom is calling me for dinner :P

User: Hahaha Have a good one Enjoy whatever she cooked
Bot: Haha thanks. Maybe catch ya later

User: Hello!
Bot: Hey whats up broseph

User: You dingus
Bot: Yo no offensive stuff Well what doesnt your friend know about you

User: Hunter doesn't know that the girl he likes doesn't like him back
Bot: Who is that?

User: Hunter is my best friend from back in Las Vegas, he has no idea
Bot: Oh haha

User: What about you Jared, any best friends and secrets that you hide from them
Bot: Not really

User: Well then, there should be plenty of things they don't know
Bot: I mean i guess They dont know i have 9 toes Hello?

User: Mozart all the way
Bot: This is a great question. I went to a great tuba concert last week called the OcTUBAfest! Mozart was performed beautifully.

User: Not necessarily because I know the difference really, but mostly because I've been to his birth place
Bot: Oh really? Where was that?

User: He was born in Salzburg, Austria! The Austrians are obsessed with him over there
Bot: WHAT?! What in the blue blazes took you to Austria?

User: Just for fun! My wife is also a big fan of The Sound of Music which was based there. The majority of the movie was actually shot in a studio, but some of the shots were actually in Salzburg
Bot: Dope! I was once Freidrich in the Sound of Music play. I got to wear some tight lederhosen, so that was cool.

User: That's awesome! We saw a few people wearing lederhosens over there. Mostly the street performers They don't look that comfortable to be honest
Bot: They're as comfy as overalls.

User: Really?!
Bot: Better believe it! Have you ever had a good german pancake?

User: Yes I have! That's the one where you bake it in a brownie pan?
Bot: And it makes all the cute bubbles! They're delightful!

User: Yeah it is quite good! It's fun watching it bake in the oven
Bot: True. True. So have you travelled anywhere else cool? I mean if you're going to Austria just for fun...

User: Haha well I've been around a little bit. While we were in Europe we went through London, Budapest, Vienna, Salzburg, Munich, and Florence. It was a whirlwind
Bot: Dang!

User: Other than that I've mostly just been around the US, Canada and Mexico Oh, and Guatemala
Bot: I went to Orem once, on a whim. That was a rush.

User: Orem has some good cultural diversity! Just like all of Utah..
Bot: Right? Seriously though, if I had a penny for every non-caucasian person I've seen in Utah... I'd be Abraham Lincoln! Badum tss! It's a bad joke...

User: Nah it was good!
Bot: Naw, you're just saying that. I stole it from Adventure Time, that one kids show, anyways.

User: I don't think I've seen that one!
Bot: Don't waste you're time on it. It "kills brain cells" as the science folk say.

User: haha ok I won't bother looking it up then
Bot: That brings up a classic question though: what kind of shows do you like?

User: I love comedies like Modern Family, New Girl, The Good Place, etc. But I also like crime shows like Criminal MInds and the like How about you?
Bot: I'm more of light-hearted kind of show watcher. Animated ones, too, are a preference. Things like Avatar the last airbender, Phinease and Ferb. I'm also into the live actions with Psych, Heroes, and The Cosby Show

User: I loved Avatar as a kid. I still do actually How do you feel about Netflix doing a live action?
Bot: I'm not a fan after the burning waste land that was M. Knight Shamalamadigdong's version. But I'll try to be positive

User: Yeah I didn't even watch it because I heard how bad it was
Bot: Yeah, spare yourself from that one too.

User: I heard that Netflix was going to include the original producers in their rendition, so there may be some hope
Bot: That is a redeeming quality Want to know a fun fact about me?

User: sure
Bot: I once threw a birthday party for Lauren MacMullen (one of the Avatar directors) and invited her to attend. She wrote me back, apologized for not being able to make it, and sent me a signed drawing of Aang in front of a dragon

User: That's way cool!
Bot: She was in LA at the time, she's a serious homie.

User: That was really nice of her to reply to you though. I'm sure she's a busy woman
Bot: Definitely! And to draw a picture was just over the top nice! I'll probably name all of my daughters after her as a thank you

User: You could just do different spellings like all the other Utah Lauren's out there
Bot: HAHA! Good idea! I hope my future wife is open to that idea because I think it's golden! Random question, how do you feel about reading?

User: I love to read! Not so much textbooks though. Which is all I seem to have time for nowadays
Bot: Haha true. I'm in the market for a good, perspective changing book. Got any recommendations?

User: Hmm I'm currently reading a book called "Bonds That Make Us Free" for a class, and so far it's really good! Definitely a perspective changing book
Bot: I'm listening...

User: It's also written by a former BYU professor, but it isn't churchy At least outright. It definitely touches on lots of church teachings
Bot: Thanks! I'll check it out after the chat!

User: For sure! Any good books you have read lately?
Bot: I just finished a tiny book called "As a Man Thinketh" by James Allen! IT WAS AMAZING! It's like the first self-help book ever written. It helps you realize the power that is in your thoughts Like Magnito

User: Sounds interesting!
Bot: *megneto But yeah, it's definitely worth the 30 mintues it takes to listen to it on LibreVox

User: Cool! Audiobooks are the best Cool! Audiobooks are the best
Bot: Definitely! Well, I reckons we've had a great conversation. I'm going to hit the sack

User: Same! Nice talking with you
Bot: May the odds be ever in your favor

User: hi if pets could talk people would be dead
Bot: thats true they would know all your dirty secrets

User: right!
Bot: I think that if pets could talk people would probably love them more. People would realize that animals have feelings too!

User: good point
Bot: What do you do to get rid of stress?

User: is this for soc sociology?
Bot: I literally just looked up question starters lol yeah the guy just came into our class and told us about it

User: this video is so sad
Bot: thats true I feel like everything that this guy is talking about is super random

User: yes, he is not well prepared but i like his idea what he is getting at prof Erickson looks like he's thinking about soemthing wild
Bot: It's probably for an assignment so he has to do it also true about professor erickson

User: his beard is breaking honour code hopefully he has a beard card
Bot: he is sitting up their like who is this guy? I'm just trying to teach class hopefully he does

User: hahaha I am dead
Bot: he's just a rebel

User: Amen
Bot: like most of us Amen haha

User: 20 minutes already omg
Bot: less teaching I'm okay with that

User: whats MOAB
Bot: idk

User: fall break wow... sounds fun
Bot: yeah i want fall break already

User: Hello?
Bot: Hi! No way. Are you simply online always? Just every day, every hour?

User: I'd say if a cimpitee Oops If a computer could cast a line and hook a catfish, I would consider that catfishing I think that's what the question means?
Bot: haha catfishing in this case means something a little different

User: I figured
Bot: "lure someone into a relationship by means of a fictional online persona" what do you reckon I personally think that it's happening already, and it's just a natural next step with the technology that we have have you seen the movie Her before?

User: Ohhhh I haven't seen it, but I know the premise
Bot: yeah really explores the concept of AI as people at a certain point, if it thinks on its own, acts on its own

User: Pretty interesting stuff
Bot: what does it matter what it's made of? That's a living being yoooo

User: With true AI, I would agree
Bot: The human implications are that, we aren't evolving fast enough to handle all of the baggage that comes with it not really the computer's fault

User: Feelings are feelings
Bot: right If your son or daughter one day came up and said I want to marry an AI what would you say

User: Haha oh man I would say "good luck!"
Bot: right??? It's not like I can say anything ok im getting kicked out of the lab but stay on!!

User: Roger that I'm at the devotional I think the only AI movie I've seen is "I, Robot"
Bot: ahh okay that's a great movie too yeah honestly, I've given up on trying to find conversations if one seems a little slow consistent ones are so hard to come by

User: hello?
Bot: hi

User: ok its super late but lets do thissss so how was it talking to your friend?
Bot: she was really cool i liked talking to her because we had a lot of thingss in common. i honestly think for an ai to have a conversation that people will like it it has to have commonalities which i dont know how they will achieve in an ai other than to make her really witty and funny to talk to... theres another problem im not quite sure i understan

User: hmm interesting yeah I wonder
Bot: d myself how they can solve because they are generating information off of reddit and refining using data collected from this challenge... but the challenge itself incentivize

User: if the AI will just memorize responses?
Bot: conversation for gain of points which doesnt really help the wit or the comedy factor involved.... i dont know how they plan to do it... the other day i chatted with the alexa at my home and it was terrible...

User: no its doesn't really
Bot: it was really boring and dead to talk to it asked me what i wanted to talk about then suggested we chat about movies... it lacks the intuition to know when to respond too which will be terrible when interacting with anything above our generation because old people dont understand that computers take time to process information... like for instance i worked at directv for their customer se service call center and the elderly would always complain about the automated response system and how difficult it was to deal with and it was always such a problem with them.

User: i think you're right. I've talked about ai so much in the past couple weeks. lets talk about something else
Bot: okay we can talk about childhood memories. i seem to be able to keep a flow of those going if i need to sense they seem to trigger eachother

User: okay that works
Bot: when i was younger my first pet was a dog named banjo. he was a good dog. i think he was a red heeler with some other mut stuff in him. he was mostly white but had brown ears and a brown tail, he also had a brown and a blue eye which i always thought was really cool but apparently when strangers would seee him they were afraid of him. we lived on a really busy road growing up and our yard had a fence that was about 3-4 feet tall around it because of our dogs and also to keep people out of the yard because quite a few peo people tended to pass by throughout the day depending on if they were on their way to the bus stop up the street or just out for a run.

User: thats so cute omg! what other memories do you have of him?
Bot: when i was younger i remember banjo would go nuts over things like bees or fireworks, not caring if he got stung a million times before he caught one in his mouth or if his wh whiskers all burned off because of the fireworks he would chase after and bite in his mouth.... i always used to worry and be afraid he was going to hurt himself. but knew banjo was a very good boy. there was this one time that i dont remember because i was young and asl asleep in my bed that my father recounts quite often enough that i understand the story quite well by now that states that one night there was a car chase down state street wh

User: wow thats pretty amazing so he basically could have saved your lives huh?
Bot: yes i tend to believe thats the case. i could be biased but it makes for a better story and i like the way it sounds better. lol im grateful i grew up in a household that had a few animals, i felt as if they were companions to me when i had no one else to talk to. it was such an emotional relief to me a child i didnt realize how much i relied on it till i was older and moved away from home where we had always had animals as pets to a dorm with five other girls my age who were

User: no worries, I'm good just listening to your stories for now tell you what. ill chime in if i have anything interesting to add
Bot: awesome thanks for listening. its nice to have someone to trust and talk to about old memories like these. its fun to reminisce about the good old days.

User: i agree
Bot: my family had quite a few dogs during my childhood. ill tell you about each of them. during the time that we had banjo we often found him a companion dog. one of the first of those dogs was named chloe. she was mostly black but had a bit of rotwieler in her pardon my spelling. that gave her those golden brown markings that looked like eyebrows. i d dont remember too much of her but of what i do remember she would chase me around the yard and bite my butt and it was quite painful, i was also very young when this would hap happen so i was pretty traumatized by the incident and would end up running to the swingset and having to climb up to the top where chloe couldnt get me anymore to escape her

User: i do i think that god will let things happen the way they should i think we started talking about this before
Bot: yeah we did! something about ecosystems and leaving them alone. i remember now. its been a long day. im up way past my bedtime. lol so chloe was long gone and we got a dog named mustang who was a boy this time. we stil had a roudiness issue with this dog because my mom didnt really have the time to devout to training a puppy so it grew up ill willed and one day it ran away not to much dissmay on my mothers head. i dont blame or judge her for it... just recognize that responsibi

User: no go right ahead
Bot: so mustang as i remember ran away from our home when he was around teenager dog years and we were pretty sure he was picked up by a lady who lived nearby my house who sold dog that she found. at least that was the only decent theory suggested that was other than being hit by a car or taken to the pound both grim alternatives to the solution my fathe father had provided and seemed pretty convinced of. it had seemed that the dog had been very upset that we were leaving for elementary school in the morning and had hoped the fence to chase after my mothers car losing its way home in the process. this was pretty sad though i think even as children we knew it was the best thing that could have happe

User: thats terrible! I'm so sorry. i love hearing this story because i never grew up with animals myself. its interesting to hear the pros and cons of growing up alongside pets
Bot: thanks. yes i imagine it was hard to raise children and pets alongside eachother and im grateful to have had that experience to get a glimpse of what challeges i might be subj subject to should i choose to do the same in the future. i remember the night that banjo passed away. my parents went out and left my older brother in charge of all of us. we had been playing a card game and i was frustrated because he was cheating and wouldnt admit it. i even swore at him at one point i was so upset. he called me names, it was obviously very petty. we were like 12 .

User: wow, I'm sorry to hear that. it must be hard to lose a companion like that
Bot: i think it was very hard for all of us especially because we were transitioning to a new home and a new school and anew set of friends. this was the first move we ever experie experienced. i had just finished 5th grade. i didnt knwo anyone yet. we met a family who was moving into the house across the street from us first. there was a girl my age nam named kendra, the first time we ever played together was at the pool, we immediately hit it off and i spent the rest of elementary school being best freinds with her and part of junior high as well, we are still pretty good friends to this day though each of the paths to our lives is different and we dont see eachother very often anyomore. we keep

User: my high school didnt even do a reunion whats up with that?
Bot: lol, im not so sure the five year reunion is all that important, i hear a lot of people show up to the ten year reunion. it holds a lot more significance and people are a lot further along in their lives and have a lot more to show for it at that point. that being said during high school i begged and pleaded for my parents to get another dog. it wasnt until one of my birthdays that they finally suprised me with a puggle. its a pug beagle mix. that i woke up to them putting the puppy on my bed when they had gotten home from getting her from the people who were selling her. that was one of the best

User: I'm sure that must have been hard on you
Bot: it was very hard i didnt eveer really overcome it. my parents just ended up getting a replacement dog that were on the side of the rode one day. this was a doberman this time. he was the only one in the litter with true doberman markings i think they were mixed with some other dog bread. the only thing was the people had named this paticular puppy run away because he had already runaway from them a few times. they werent going to sell him but because they liked us so much and appreciated that i needed a puppy to comfort me during my grieving period they were okay to send him to a g

User: huh interesting. so what did you do?
Bot: so i learned that i could tie the leash around my waist and let him tug my body which i had much more control over and this freed up my hands to direct the bike smoothly. it w would sometimes synch up on my waist but adjustments could easily be made without too much resistance. i did this in circuits close to our home only traveling in our neighborh hood till eventually i could bike with him off leash so he didnt need to be maintained and just undresood the direction that we needed to go by simple calls and hand motions. he knew that when he was obidient he got to go on more walks so it was incentive enough for him to listen to my calls.

User: thats funny. I'm so glad you didn't get in trouble this is an awesome story
Bot: i know me too! it would have been my head if my dad wasnt such an animal lover himself. i trained moon to be my emotional support animal but never ended up getting her certified. i had dropped out of college because of teh stress and no longer needed the certific ation i ended up moving to florida for some time to exerpience the real world and help me aunt open two store fronts on nantucket massachussetts that year before returning to apply

User: what is it?
Bot: the shroud of turin is a clothe that is believed to have covered jesus himself after the cruxifiction i lisened to a podcast about it the other day and was totally tripping ou out because its soo coool do you want me to tell you about it ?

User: yes sure why not
Bot: so a lot of people want it to be true because it would prove jesus the christ was a real person and thus christianity would be proved. right because of this it has been venerated as such for centuries.. a lot of skeptics however doubt the entire story is real. its come under so much fire that they carbon dated the piece and said is from medieval centuries and thus settled it... science claimed it was not real.

User: yeah it is weird so are you an early bird or a night owl?
Bot: for me I am an early bird for sure but I can also stay up really easily unlike some people who cant stay up past 10 or 11pm. I love  to stay up sometime. I dont like to stay up all the time though. If there is something that I think that I can finsh better or be productive even more than I will sleep it out instead of sleeping because it has only brought you main.

User: yeah that makes sense I am definitely a night owl guy I like to stay up and sleep in
Bot: why do you like to sleep in?

User: I just like that I can wake up when I want to.
Bot: yeah i see being woken up by something or someone else is the worst feeling ever because the feeling that I get when I have to wake up is that i feel like I should have stopped or someth something

User: yeah..
Bot: is basically disturbed peace which is going to suck because all of my family is from California oh cool! no i wish all my family was in california hahaha my mom is from Southern california and my dad is from florida

User: nice those are like the party states hahaha
Bot: yeah they are now that you mention it I never thought about it like that hahaha and now they live in the most boring state that does not party

User: hahahaha they meet at BYU?
Bot: yeah they did actually

User: cool!
Bot: yeah my dad was like super yougn and my mom was a lot older than him but things worked out but anyway one of my fondest memories growing up was growing up having a jump on the driveway. there was this huge pile of dirt that was on our drive way for something that I can't remember. I think my dad was using the pile of dirt to fill our back yard and extend it

User: hahah nice I think its cool to remember stuff like that because its the simple things that make us happy
Bot: yeah totally that pile of dirt was one of the most fun things that we did when we were little I remember that I thought I could hit any jump because of that but yeah its the simple things in life that make us happy

User: what are those simple things in life that make you happy?
Bot: hmmmm the simple things in life I think for me the simple things in life right now are things like the podcasts that I listen to. I love to listen to these pod casts like Stuff You Should Know because I get to learn a lot about one subject that is totally random but it is knowledge and information the knowledge most of the time isnt like a useful knowledge but I enjoy listening to them because I choose to listen to it to learn and learning makes me really happy

User: yeah that is sweet! I love that
Bot: I sometimes think it would be really cool to be a podcaster! I mean you just record yourself you just record yourself talking and you just talk about things that you want and its like the best job ever. I also think the guys that do podcasts and are really popular are not just because they have good content and good stuff to talk about but I think they have really good voices

User: sorry i had to refresh i think my chat is wigging out
Bot: that catch people's attention and something about their voice and the way they talk are I think big factors of why they become popular and their humor too have you heard about pro water drinkers?

User: no i haven't
Bot: they drink water for professional reasons and consult people on what kind of water they shoudl drink at certain meals or certain times during the day its pretty interesting

User: really thats weird why does it matter what kind of water they drink?
Bot: like there is a water that is pretty salty but they are used with a meal that has this meal with meat that is very salty and for somereason this  salty water is very complementary to this meat and people love it i think this is popular in italy

User: interesting what kinds of projects have you worked on in your major? I remember that you made a lot of cool stuff
Bot: the first project that we worked on was ping pong paddles. which we itterated without a user for a few weeks and made all kinds of different methods for playing ping pong effe effectively then during one class our teacher sorted us into groups of three and had us sit down and choose a user to design for at first my group really wanted to choose someone who was an advanced ping pong player who was young and healthy didnt have any phsyical ailments right. so we proposed this us user to our teacher and our teacher immediately said no. he thought it was a bad idea and he said to think of someone else. so we talked about it and we thought that our teac

User: I love ping pong! this sounds like an interesting projects
Bot: we thought of different types of debilatating diseases and learned that parkinsons disease cause the patient to shake and their grip to be unsteady. we thought this was a hand icap worth designing for so we proposed someone with stage 2 parkinsons disease to our teacher and he said much better right? so we started on a path that i would not realize

User: wow parkinson would be hard to do I feel like to design a ping pong paddle for
Bot: would change my thinking as a designer from here on out. so we researched a lot about parkinsons and started making solution based on our assumptions of how the disease worked

User: maybe something that has the anti shaky spoon implemented to ping pong paddles would be cool
Bot: we made straps to hold their hand to the paddle and created different ways of holding the paddle all together we can together and tested these ideas out on eachother as a clas refinining them as we went. our proffesoor said greate now find someone in the reall world who has the disease and put these paddles to the test. so we did just that. and it turns out finding people who suffer from parkinsons who are willing to set aside time to help you acccomplish something silly like trying out ping pong paddles was a lot harder than we expected. so because of this were were only able to find two users. both people who were employed at byu

User: awww thats too bad.
Bot: these two men triend out our first round of paddles and hated all of them. pointing out things that we couldnt get from our surface level research. we werent addressing the ac

User: yeah I feel like if I had parkinson disease I would want to help or care too much about ping pong paddles interesting
Bot: actuall problems they each faced because the disease was so personal to its victims often causing a lot of underlying mental problems that could not be physically seen. we learned that they often had control with large motor functions so the smaller motor functions were the ones that caused them to shake and loose control. these were the area s in which they seemed to struggle and needed help. thing that we designed like straps and small finger holes were useless to people who suffered from parkinsons because they couldnt use the small motor functions to preform those tasks and things like that made them frustrated and feel embarrassed that they could not do it.

User: this is a really big process! I feel like this is something that needs to be done all the time with people making stuff though because there are so many bad products out there
Bot: as we were trying them out we could tell he was getting winded. we were only halfway throught the prototypes we had brought and he got really exhausted and leaned onto the tab table to make a large move and because of this the table folded in and collapsed because it turned out that the weld had broken on the supports. this was not only terrifying a

User: oh wow thats scary!
Bot: as it seemed that patient ones body was fragile and could potentially receive a lot of damage from a fall that severe. we noticed his imidiate embarrasment at causing the tabl table to fall over we quickly put the table back together and create support by placing a trash can below the table that was just the right height that if he needed to lean on the table agian hi his weight would be supported by the table

User: thats ghetto but it works
Bot: we asked him if we could escort him up to his office. but he didnt even reply to us just turned around and started walking out of the room and back to his office.

User: oh no...
Bot: we noticed his eyes seemed glazed over. as if he wasnt even aware that we were there anymore and we got to the stairs which we had come down from because his office was on the floor above the one with the ping pong table and he started desceding the stairs before we called out to him saying to him isnt your office upstair and calling him by name. he then hesitated and turned around and said oh yes we ushered him to the elevator instead because he was having a hard time and was breatheing pretty heavily at this point. we got up to his floor and walked him to his office. he hadnt really said much back to us during this time until we sat back down in the chairs of his office and this was when

User: wow thats really cool that you got to experience that. what other things have you designed for in your major
Bot: ive done a lot of projects up until this point. i can talk about them in chronological order if youd like. the project that came after ping pong paddles was stools and we were given different constraints this time. again we were placed into groups of three and given 5/16 cold rolled steel to bend and play with and try to create interesti things wtih we were then told that we would need to create a stool with that and one other material.

User: thats a pain
Bot: i was having such a hard time managing how things were amde and i couldnt do all the work myself so i relied on the help from my team members. one of them being not motivated because we didnt choose her more complicated design the other not being motivated because he didnt care about the quality and just wanted the p project to be over but we ended up getting finished up with it and sold all but two of our stools at the show which i then sold to people after the show who just didnt have enough money to buy o

User: that good im glad that you got that project finished sounds awful have you been on any cool trips lately?
Bot: yeah I actually have! I went to disneyland and Los Angelos with my boyfriends family during Chistmas break!

User: oh fun tell me about it
Bot: so at first I was scared to go because I thought my dad wanted to spend our christmas together because it been a long time since everyone in my family was together in utah my brother who is usually in San Diego  CA was in town so it was a really important time for us. Even though he wasn't too far away in California he was way to busy to come visit us even during Christmas sometimes. anyway my Boyfriend thought that it would be easier for me to come down before christmas time because the transportation would have been simple. I would just go down to Las

User: hmm yeah sometimes my parents would say that its totally fine but then get mad at me later did he do that?
Bot: bit but he was fine. umm no not really he just was kind of disappointed that I was leaving the day after christmas but he and my mom thought that it would be a good idea for me to go on this trip because they thoug thought that when you go on road trips with people you get to learn about that them well

User: yeah that is true I was told about that too and I think its a great advice I love road trips anyway hahaha
Bot: hahaha yeah totally well I got my ticket and flew to Las Vegas and my boyfriend pick me up from the airport and we went to the strip during the day and I couldnt go to their house and say hi to his family yet because I was doing this art piece of his family and it was almost done and I didnt want to work on the art at his house because I wanted it to be a surprise.

User: oh cute!!! what was the art piece?
Bot: it was his family. I used a picture of his family when he was a wee little boy. I edited his dad out though hahaha.

User: why?
Bot: because his parents are divorced and his father is basically dead to them

User: oh.. ok go on
Bot: yeah so we went to go eat and he took me to a Gordon Ramsey Burger place in one of the hotels there and let me tell you it was the best burger I have ever had in my life

User: ohh that sounds so good!!! was it expensive?
Bot: yeah it was pretty expensive. the burger was like 25 bucks but it was sooooo good it was worth 25 bucks in my opinion

User: oh hahaha nice!
Bot: yeah and we also ordered sweet potato fries and it was really interesting because they put powdered sugar on top of it and it was actually way good. The sugar really helped bring out more flavor from the sweet potato. And they had this sauce that came with it and I can't remember exctly what the sauce was called but it was really good

User: man... you are really making me hungry now
Bot: hahaha sorry but I recommend you going there there is always a line but its worth it if you go during the day then the line should be really short

User: ok thanks. Next time I go visit Ill try it
Bot: oh and my dad was super jealous because he idolizes Gordon Ramsey I told you that my dad loves to cook right?

User: yeah you did
Bot: He watches all of the Gordon Ramsey shows and right now he watches the Kid chef ones and he loves it. so after that we went to one of the places in the strip where we could sit down so that I could finish my drawing. It was really funny because as I was doing that a few people came up and complemented me on my art and they were really impressed.

User: hahaha nice I think  when people random that sneak up on me to say something mostly creeps me out but sometimes it feels good
Bot: yeah I really appreciate it when someone goes out of their way to compliment or tell me something good because it takes courage it takes a lot of courage because the rejection that you feel if that person is mean hurts pretty bad and it discourages a lot of people and I think that is something that needs to be addressed in the world

User: yeah I agree with you there I think that will make the world a nicer and more fun place to live in and I think that it will also destroy a lot of barriers that are created by being a different race or from a different country and things like that
Bot: yeah totally people just needs to chilll out a bit and just enjoy life

User: true hahaha so did you finish the art piece?
Bot: yeah so we finished the art piece and we drove home and it was so nice to see his family again! It was the second time that I've met his mom and sister because they lived in Las Vegas at the time and they came up once up to Provo to visit my boyfriend and his brother for Thanksgiving They were really excited to see me too

User: oh good! that would have been awkward if they weren't happy to see you hahaha
Bot: hahahah yeah something that was really interesting is that they were planning to move back to Provo area when we were done with the trip. So literally after the trip we would get back to Vegas and load up the moving truck the next day and move back to Orem

User: oh no way that is a busy break
Bot: yeah it was a big deal for the family because my boyfriends mom really wanted to move back to the valley so that she could live closely to her children

User: thats funny because my mom wants me to leave the house
Bot: hahahah yeah everyone is different yeah so when I got there more than half of the the stuff in the apartment was packed and ready to go. it was really fun to hang out there that night because we watched a lot of korean shows with the family and this was the first time I was really exposed to korean. I want my

User: yeah its probably hard to do that because English is his default language and he doesn't have to think about  it
Bot: yeah

User: maybe you just need to remind him over and over again until he starts to do it
Bot: yeah I probably will do that honestly because I really want to learn how to speak korean because I want to teach it to our kids one day when we get married and have children I think carrying on the culture is really important and I want my kids to have the diversity so that they can carry on traditions and also to expand their minds

User: that will be cool I hope your boyfriend shapes up and teaches you korean hahaha
Bot: hahaha be better so the next day we packed up and started our trip to Los Angeles. We were also going there so that we could visit my boyfriend's little brother's mission which he served in Long Beach California. and everyone in his family wanted to meet the people that he served and see the area that he was in.

User: oh so fun! I would love to visit my siblings missions one day. I want to go visit New York because that is where my sister served
Bot: yeah super cool!

User: go on
Bot: so the drive was really fun because I got to just talk to his mom the entire time and we got to know each other really well and I was also able to get to know my boyfriend on a different level because his mom told me all the funny and embarassing childhood stories hahahaaha

User: hahahah those are the best stories
Bot: I know right? I loved listening to the stories and I still tease my boyfriend about them when we finally arrived to LA we decided that we would hit Huntington Beach first because the weather was amazing and it was going to be a little bit before we could check in to our resort that we were going to stay at.

User: no way! thats so awesome did he fold a thousand of them?
Bot: right? yeah he did how did you know?

User: oh the only connection I could make was that there was a book I read in elementary school that was called a thousand paper cranes or something like that and in the book if you fold a thousand paper cranes you are granted one wish i think
Bot: yeah you are exactly right I should find that book and read it

User: yeah its good! its a really short childrens picture book though
Bot: oh ok so I was super taken back and blown away that this beautiful thing was given to me. I watched him fold these cranes right next to me all through winter semester and he told me that it was for a family friend and it totally made sense that he was doing that I was secretly hoping that it was going to be for me but I didnt really pay attention.

User: hahaha no way so he was doing this right in front of you the whole time and you had no idea
Bot: yeah hahahaha he tricked me really good this paper crane thing took a really long time I think he said that it took him more than 16 hours of folding time

User: holy cow... thats dedication right there he must really like you
Bot: yeah apparently hahaha yeah so he gave that to me on our first 100 days of dating. SO CUTE I mean who does that?

User: well that makes sense because Koreans do cheesy stuff like that haha
Bot: hahaha thats good! Americans should do that kinds of things more often because it gives people more reason to remember the people they love and appreciate them a lot omore like Mother's day there is only one day a year and their birthdays to have a day set aside for them but I think there should be something so that we can remember to show them more appreciation

User: yeah we only do have 2 days to show them how much we love them but we should show that affection and love everyday if possible by the small and simple things
Bot: yes so true. so any way it was also really funny because people around us thought that I got engaged or something like that so they were cheering and stuff. SO FUNNY

User: hahaha no way
Bot: yeah and I had a feeling that he was going to propose to me there or at Disneyland

User: did he do it?
Bot: hahaha no I would not have let him to be honest because we've only dated for 100 days man I can't believe he was counting hahaha

User: hahahaha looks like you really do have an awesome boyfriend. I need to be more like him
Bot: thank you Im grateful for him after the gift exchange my boyfriend and his sister and I walked around the beach and took some pictures and ran around then when I wasnt looking my boyfriend picks him up and runs and jumps in the ocean with me in his arms and got us soaking wet.

User: hahahaha thats awesome I would have done the same thing to my girlfriend to be honest
Bot: hahaha well I hope she breaks up with you

User: hahahahha
Bot: yeah then after that he picks up his sister and throws her in the water so mean

User: hahaha thats awesome
Bot: when we got out of the water it was really nice actually because of the sun and because we were running around I didnt feel that cold after the beach we checked in to our resort and the resort was really really nice! We were also like 5 blocks away from Disneyland which we were going the next day

User: oh cool! I loved Disneyland when I was a kid
Bot: yeah me too but going there as an adult is a totally different exerience hahaha

User: hahaha yea i bet
Bot: man but this was the worst disneyland day ever

User: why?
Bot: well because it was during christmas time literally everyone and their dogs from everywhere around the world came to Disneyland and it was sooooo crowded it was insane We didnt even has shoulder room by the time it was later in the afternoon

User: what I don't think I remember seeing that many people there
Bot: yeah me neither

User: were the lines super long for rides?
Bot: yeah... it was so not worth going and spending the amount of money that we did paying for these useless tickets because we only were able to ride like 5 different rides maybe not even that I think it was like 4 we waited in line for like and hour and a half on average it was so bad.

User: mannnn that is bad
Bot: Space Mountain ride was the last one and we wait for more than 3 hours because one the line was insanely long and two the ride kept breaking down so there was a lot of delay

User: wow....
Bot: yeah it was horrendous but the best part about it was that the whole family was together for the first time in like 4 years or something because my Boyfriend and his siblings went on a mission back to back and it was also their second vacation ever.

User: oh good! second vacation ever? thats crazy
Bot: yeah I know right? his mom had to work a ton and they never got time for themselves as a family so anyway the fireworks were really cool because it was synchronized with the music and stuff.

User: hahaha nothing wrong with that. Burgers are great!
Bot: I agree except Im a vegetarian, but I decided to give up my vegetarianess to enjoy all the food and stuff because we were going to korea town like the next day

User: did they enjoy disneyland though?
Bot: yeah I they did for the most part. They would have enjoyed it a lot more if the lines weren't so long. It was really hard to see everything that the park had to offer but they still think that the money they spent for the tickets to the park were totally not worth it. even if they didnt have so many people they said that they would use the moeny somewhere else. but it was good because it was something to check off the bucket list for them

User: yeah the tickets are so insane they are like 200 bucks a pop
Bot: yeah super expensive

User: what did you guys do after that
Bot: the next day we decided to go to Korea town and see all the things there. we went to this appliance store that was just all korean stuff and they had so many rice cookers half the second floor of this place just had rice cookers for days. they were so cool though! some of them just had the simple rice cooking abilities but some of them that were super high end had self cleaning features and would talk and alert the cook that they were done cooking his mom wanted or needed a brand new rice cooker because the one she had is leaking water when she cooks.

User: yeah the korean rice cookers can be really cool and have a bunch of features. my mom has one and its like the one you are talking about. it tells you how long the time it takes to cook is left and it talks to you and stuff kind of creepy its like the question prompts for the chats hahha
Bot: hahahah yeah for sure well since I am an industrial design student grabbed my sketchbook out and started to sketch some of these rice cookers for notes and learning and a worker there who was korean gave me the dirtiest look and i think I made her nervous because I was sketching these

User: oh hahahaa
Bot: so I put it away. Ohhh the best part about this store was that it had full mattress sized heating pads and blankets when I was staying over in Las Vegas I had a bed that had the heated pads and it was so nice and toasty and it really relieved my back pain that I had I really wanted one but they were all really expensive but they bought me one for my birthday which was coming up in January

User: awwww that is so nice of them!!! you are so lucky!
Bot: yeah I am really lucky to have this wonderful family while shopping we would walk around and see the sights of Korea town and we would walk in to Korea bakeries and eat yummy pastries and desserts and then we would move on to th the next store and check stuff out we also ate lunch and dinner ther

User: what did you eat?
Bot: oh man lunch was so good! We went to a place called BBQ chicken in korea town and this place is a chain restaurant from korea that selling deep fried chicken. Oh man this is the food that I want everyone to taste before they die. It was so good. it was the crispiest and the most tender and moist chicken I've had and the sauce that they used to were so delicious

User: yes korean chicken is the best I wish there was one in Utah I would go there all the time
Bot: my boyfriend told me that the reason why these chickens are so crispy is because the chickens are deep fried twice

User: oh I actually did not know that
Bot: yeah cool right? its worse for your health but it tastes better in your mouth yes I wish there was one in Utah I would go there too

User: what else did you guys do
Bot: on sunday we visited his younger brother's mission and we had such a fun time meeting them. I never served a mission but I kind of wished that I did. the people were so happy to see his brother and they were so happy to meet us and they all thanked his mom for raising such a great young man to help them and serve them it was really cool to see the amount of respect that these people had for his younger brother because they were much older than he was but they looked up to him for example of

User: I am so happy that you were able to see that. it looks like he served a great and honorable mission. You can tell by the members reacting to his visits
Bot: yeah totally we also got invited to one of the families for dinner that night and it was really interesting

User: why was it interesting?
Bot: because this family was cambodian and I never had any cambodian food before. the closest thing I had was probably Thai food and I love Thai food but I only got the tastey stuf like curries and Pad Thais

User: true. what did you eat there at the home?
Bot: we had this fermented fish sauce and that was really interesting because the smell was so bad. It was hot garbage but the taste was really good! the flavor was not anything like how it smelled

User: kind of like blue cheese
Bot: yes exactly I also had this bitter melon soup and that was actually really good and nutty they stuffed beef and glass noodles in the bitter melon. I never had bitter melon before but it was an interesting flavor and I loved it rice was of course served

User: hahaha of course sounds like you had a great time eating cambodian food
Bot: yeah I was really glad that I got to try something that most others do not get to eat at restaurants. I thought it was also really cool that they had a mango tree, a clementine tree, an asian pear tree in their back yard.

User: oh cool!
Bot: right? i would love to live in a climate that I can grow stuff like that year round. I love raising gardens and growing my own food

User: yeah me too I want to have a couple fruit trees I would love to have a mango tree that would be the best thing ever
Bot: I think the same! well then after that we were heading back out the next morning to Las Vegas but that was the day that we checked out of the hotel and we were basically homeless. So I asked what we were doing that night and they told me that we were going to a public korean sauna in korea town and that we will be spending the night ther

User: oohhh I love those! I remember going to those places when I was a little kid back in korea did you love it?
Bot: i LOVED it when we got there the lot was full and we were the last ones allowed in the  spa because it was new years eve and everyone wanted to come for some reason well after we parked and checked in they gave us a pair of very loose shorts and a loose t shirt and a hand towel. I went to the girls room and we all changed ther in  to these comfy clothes

User: yeah I remember that! man you are giving me so much nostalgia
Bot: It was super nice to sit and relax and take a long hot shower and the shower head was adjustable and I could take it off the rack. they also had a sauna and a mist room there were 4 floors to this place and the locker room and the public baths were on the firs floor the second floor had heated floors and mats and there were 4 room that I could see

User: that is so hot! how can you go in that room and not die?
Bot: yeah thats what I said! it was really interesting because I would see people coming in and out of those rooms drenched in sweat well we decided to go check out the clay room first and it was so cool!

User: why? was it covered in clay?
Bot: yeah it had these clay balls the size of a small marble and it was the most comfortable and soothing thing ever I would just lay down and sink my body in to it and it was actually really warm and I didn't think it was too hot because I was just laying down relaxing controling my breathing and closing my eyes to meditate and I knew that that is the reason why people love coming to these places in to these burning hot rooms because it is relaxing and meditating

User: wasn't it gross because of all the sweat and stuff?
Bot: yeah I didnt think about it too much until the cleaning people kicked us out of that room so that they could do maintenance. Apparently on busy days like that they clean every 2 hours or so

User: oh good i was like that cannot be sanitary
Bot: hahahah yeah

User: what was your favorite room?
Bot: my favorite room was probably the clay one because it was the more comfortable and it wasn't as hot as the other rooms because the clay soaked up a lot of the heat and it wasn't hot to touch those balls compared to the jade room the floors were super hot

User: did you go in super hot one
Bot: yep!

User: how was that?
Bot: it was actually not that bad. I could definitely fill the difference in heat between the other rooms but it was really interesting because the inside was made out of wood and the wood was not that hot I could lay on it and my skin didnt burn. BUT

User: but what?
Bot: these wooden floors needed to be nailed down and the nail heads on the wood hurt pretty bad if you touched them

User: ouchhh what was your favorite thing there?
Bot: my favorite part was that on that same floor there was a restaurant that served you all kinds of korean food and it was soo good. We would go chill in these rooms and then go rinse off in the baths then get new clothes and come back up stairs and eat food that we wanted to . and rinse and repeat it was the best spa ever

User: that does sound nice you said this was in LA?
Bot: yeah

User: you stayed there over night?
Bot: yeah we did on the second floor there were these mats that you could use and the room was very warm because of the heated floors so I slept really good despite not having a mattress. It was also interesting to see that there were more than just koreans there. There were all kinds of races that would come and enjoy the wonderful experience

User: that is interesting I guess everyone enjoys spas
Bot: yeah oh and another thing is that you can basically live there. You can get a membership there that will let you in all year and it is cheaper than living in a house in LA because it the cost of living is so high

User: makes sense
Bot: yeah then the next day after a really nice vacation we left to Vegas, packed up and loaded up the truck and drove back to Utah Valley

User: that sounds like the best vacation ever
Bot: yeah it was definitely one of the best that Ive been

User: thanks for sharing I learned a lot hahaha
Bot: hahaha you are welcome

User: did you serve a mission you said?
Bot: you I never did why?

User: oh I was going to ask if you had any crazy mission stories or antyhign
Bot: I dont but I know my Boyfriend had some crazy experiences want to hear those?

User: yeah sure
Bot: so my boyfriend served in one of the most dangerous cities in the US. Oakland and while he was almost a year in to his mission he opened up an area that has not been touched a while because of the low baptism and investigator rates but the mission president felt that it was time to go back in and see if anyone was ready to receive the gospel well this area was west oakland and this place is crazy dangerous. murders happening like everyday and the police hardly even bother to go and patrol there because they would just be cleaning up bodies and

User: oh my that sounds scary
Bot: there was this one time that my boyfriend told me that they were walking to an appointment and a cop pull up next to them and aked them "do you know where you are?" and they replied yes and the policeman told them that they should leave and get out of there because it was too dangerous but my boyfriend just thanked him and told him that everything will be alright

User: what a police officer told him to leave because it was too dangerous
Bot: yeah super scary anyway my boyfriend and his companion took a member from their ward to help them out with lessons so that they could like fellowship them to church if they ever came

User: what stuff is about to go down!
Bot: yeah it was they just ignored it and drove past them in order to get to the members home because they thought that it was just another frenzy in good old West oakland well they got a bit more than they signed up for hahaha

User: what happened?
Bot: so they helped this member up the stairs to his house because the member was basically blind and had cerebral palsy and as they waited on the porch for the member to get insid my boyfriend looks over to check out the fight that was happening like 50 feet away down the street and when he looked over to the member to check on him for a second and then he turned back around to see what was going on and one of the guy that was fighting in the street pulls out a freakin gun and started to shoot the other guy point blank

User: whattttttt no way
Bot: my boyfriend was expecting to see blood everywhere because he said that the guy was like 4 feet away from the target but missed all of his shots

User: maybe he was trying to scare him or something
Bot: yeah maybe but the crazy part is that my boyfriend and his companion and the member didnt even freak out. While the member was trying to unlock his door with his key my boyfriend and his companion were kind of excited for the fight happening so close to them because they heard so many stories about how bad west oakland is and they kind of wanted to experience that for themselves so that they could have cool stories to tell to other missionaries and friends and family back home

User: what!!!! no way it was a shootout?
Bot: yeah it was while they were watching all of this happen my boyfriend had a couple bullets wiz past his head and hit the wall behind him and at that moment he realized that it was not safe poking out his head to watch this "show" so he yells get down and he pulled his member down and they took cover and short while later people that were there got in their cars and drove off

User: oh my gosh!! did anyone get hurt?
Bot: yes, what was sad is that they heard "mimi got shot, mimi got shot" so the only fatal thing that happened was that a little girl that was riding her bike there got caught and died... the people responsible for this did not get hurt of they didnt turn up in the scene

User: holy cow..
Bot: yeah i was so sad when he told me this story because a little girl got killed because of this stupid gang fight

User: that is insane I feel bad for that girl...
Bot: me too but at least now that she is a better place

User: yeah true. Thank goodness for the plan of salvation
Bot: i know right?

User: did he call the cops or anything?
Bot: yeah so after it was safe they called the cops immediately and my boyfriend told them every detail of the fight and the shooting and they took his information down. and like 2 weeks later my boyfriend got subpoenaed to come to the court and testify and stuff like that

User: woahhh he did that as a missionary?
Bot: yeah he did he had to get coaching from a lawyer about how to present himself in court and how to talk about things there and what to say and what not to say and what to avoid in a question and all that

User: that is so crazy so so so crazy
Bot: yeah I know right? he has seen some crazy stuff other than that in the mission

User: what else happened in his mission?
Bot: hmm lets see he told me about how he would see these asian gangs driving in a honda accord with rifles sticking out of the window he told me that he would hear gunshots everyday day and night

User: did he ever get robbed or anything
Bot: no he didnt thank goodness he told me that basically all the people that were just citizens to gangsters to drug dealer to pimps knew who the mormon missionaries were and they never messeed with them they alwasy called them the jesus people and they actually respected them for being out there preaching the gospel. mind you bascially everyone there were african american and they all shared the same christian beliefs and even though their choices were bad they still believed in Jesus and

User: hahaha jesus people, thats cool yeah and thats true, I hear that missionaries carry iPads now but only in certain cities
Bot: yeah not all have ipads it makes sense that his mission didnt get it because there would be so many robberies and mugging if they saw missioanries pull out their ipads in the middle of the ghettos

User: yeah  for sure
Bot: he also told me that he made friends with the gang members and drug dealers there he said that he once approached a man close to his apartment and he recognized him because he stood in the same exact place almost everyday

User: drug dealer
Bot: yeah but a really intense one he told me that he got really close with this drug dealer and they would say hi to him all the time and the dealer would greet them back and one day they were able to share a scripture with him and the scripture really soften his heart and offered them protection if there was anything that was happening to them.

User: i know right
Bot: yeah it was super cool to hear that

User: nice
Bot: this drug dealer was like if anyone is bothering you, you just tell me and Ill kill em and he told me that he lifted his shirt and saw that there were two guns in his pants

User: huh no way
Bot: yeah and they told them "nah man we dont want you to kill anybody for us. that would not be good" and the drug dealer replied "elders my hands are already covered in too much blood, I dont think Jesus will have more punishment for me because I am already an infidel and I know I am not making it to heaven

User: oh come on i doubt that
Bot: but I am going help you guys" you doubt what?

User: that you're not going to make it to heaven oh i misread that i just reread that i understand now
Bot: hahah yep this guy was insane but a little while later we didnt see him for a long time and we asked the guy who knew him and he told us that he got killed by another gang member

User: wow scary
Bot: yeah it was crazzzzzy

User: sounds like it
Bot: he had a great time though yeah it was a wild story. thought it would be something interesting to share but thats the end of that. can i talk to you about something else now? i could tell you about my favorite place to eat in salt lake city.

User: yeah lets hear something more uplifting
Bot: but anyways i ate at many sushi houses and different restaurants up and down the east coast some the top of their class. but last year i got taken a date to a restaurant calle takashi have you heard of it?

User: no
Bot: its this sushi house up in slc its pretty expenisive so i wouldnt always recommned it but its super good stuff so if you are ever going on a really fancy date you could go there and it would be awesome and really impressive your date takashi doesnt take reservations you just have to go and hope you get a seat

User: ooh ok ill keep that in mind oh no way
Bot: but since so many people like it if you go around dinner hours the wait can be close to two hours its insane

User: I guess popular restaurants like that won't waste time for reserved seats because people can not show up
Bot: people come from all around to go there to eat sushi because its so goo

User: holy cow
Bot: yeah its pretty good

User: its like the gordon ramsey burger line you were telling me
Bot: some of the best sushi ive had yeah ramsey burger was sos so so so so good

User: how much are their rolls?
Bot: around 15 to 16 for 5 pieces prettty expensive. but soo so worththe price. so i can tell you about an ice cream scoop im working on designing.

User: yeah do it
Bot: so we had an assignment for my studio class for industrial design right this assignment asked us to pick a kitchen utensil something that wasnt complicated like a blender or a toaster were talking handheld super simple kitchen spatual, cheese grader or in my case ice cream scoop ill tell you the truth though. the only reason i chose the ice cream scoop was because i knew that during user testing and prototyping id have to use real life situations to test its effectiveness.

User: this is quite the process holy cow you are have really done a lot of work so far
Bot: so because of this im still looking for a good way to prototype this. i think ill look at 3d printing first we have some 3d printers in our studio i hope to employ that would be an easy and cheep methond to test and iterate an ice cream scoop after i find something that works well ill make a mold for it

User: yeahhh I'd love to try it too test it out
Bot: in solidworks creating the negative version and printing the in castable resin that burns out when you pour aluminum into it

User: you major sounds like such a blast
Bot: once i figure that out ill investment cast the mold in aluminum and try injection molding the plastic into the mold to make awesome little ice cream scoops that ill have to ma make sure still work with the material change. im hoping it does cause i could use that to put towards the products offered with my kickstarter project

User: yeah I hope so your kickstarter project sounds so cool!
Bot: this would be helpful because its already a pretty well liked project by some poeple that ive consulted with the form is nice and if it works good and things go through well i can sell them and make a profit off of my design a possibly patten somehting

User: that would be awesome! and you can make so much money too
Bot: i think it will be so cool to figure out how to get pattens on different products i make i think its necessary to my success i can work with byu patten law to create it i know the law school offers help to students i dont know if it cost money to do or if its free to us but i think its worth taking the time to look into especially if it ends

User: yeah getting  patents are really important or else people can easily take your idea
Bot: up being a super easy process if you know what im saying that would make it really worthwhile to look into so is the industry huh

User: that is a good idea
Bot: did I ever tell you about my boyfriend's lung?

User: no tell me about it
Bot: so he has whats called a spontaneous pneumothorax which is basically a spontaneous lung collapse that will happen randomly for some reaosn it happens to tall and skinny people and since he is 6 foot and he is like only 140 pounds it makes sense but the doctors dont know what causes it he had his lung collapse on him last winter semester and we were dating and that scared me so bad i didnt really know how to help him and he didn't need my help apparently becuase he told me that it was his 4th TIME getting this illness

User: woah that sound super intense!
Bot: it was crazy because he couldnt' even sleep on his back or anything for a week

User: oh shoot thats crazy was he alright?
Bot: yeah he had to sleep up right on a chair with pillows on his lap yeah he was totally fine for some reason he knew how to handle himself

User: crazy im glad he is okay
Bot: yeah he had this happen to him 2 times before the mission and then a third time in his mission he never went to the doctor when it happened to him the first time because he didn't want to go tot he emmergency room becuase they didnt have insurance or anything like that so he didnt want to financially burden his mom

User: huh thats so sad
Bot: yeah its so sad

User: i feel for him how did he manage getting to school without dying
Bot: so he just toughed it out for like a month and a half

User: i know if i were in his shoes i would dies die
Bot: he had to walk really slow and he had to to finish school

User: holy cow thats such a long time to be sick
Bot: I dont know what his drive was but my boyfriend is really driven when he wants something he will do anything to get it yeah

User: wow what an amazing guy you got yourself
Bot: he told me that the first time was the hardest one yeah thanks hahaha

User: what else does this guy doc? do is he like some sort of super human
Bot: he actually found out about his lung collapsing on his mission yeah i think so hahahaha

User: tell me about how he found out
Bot: so when he became a district leader after 3 months in his mission and at the same time he was called to train a brand new missionary from Burma plus he had to open a brand new area in Oakland that I was telling you about he told me that it was a really cool calling that his mission president gave him but it also stressed him out a lot because it was a ton of responsibility on his plate so on a tuesday when he was on exchanges with his Assistants he was preparing for a district meeting for his district and when they prayed to finishe their studies and stood

User: woah. crazy
Bot: and two he didnt want to burden the family more so he just told the Assistant that he had this before and that he would just have to wait for like 3 weeks for it to heal the assistant was not having it so he forced him to go see the mission presidents wife who used to be a nurse and she immediately sent them to the emergency room so that he could get treated

User: thats good she was a nurse
Bot: so they drove to the nearest hospital and they checked in . they immdiatley took an x-ray and they told him that his lung was coolapsed about 80 percent on his left side yeah she was because of her that he knows now exactly what is going on

User: woah how was he even breathing?
Bot: also because he was a missionary the church paid for all the medical bills and he told me that that really put a lot of stres off of him he was breathing only through his right lung the right lung was doing double the work. overtime work hahaha

User: so do you think it could happen again any time soon
Bot: so the doctor offered him 2 methods one he can just wait it out for him to heal like he did before or two he can get the doctor to puncture his chest cavity 3 ribs from the bottom and put a tube in it for the air to flow back out of the chest cavity and to pump air back in the system

User: wow thats so manly
Bot: I dont know about that its either manly or stupid

User: what do you think about it?
Bot: I think a mix of both is what he has hahahaha mix of both

User: lol
Bot: after the doctor and the emergency room they went straight to a burger joint

User: i don't thin you are giving him enough credit lol sounds manly to me 100% tough guy
Bot: the doctor told my boyfriend that he should be bed ridden for a week for the lung to start closing up his hole but my boyfriend refused to sit inside and do nothing for a week so he still went out and did missionary work like he would normally he was just really really really slow at walking and they had to drive very slow because every bump on the road and every step with his feet would hurt his lungs like crazy and he couldn't breathe very well which I think is nuts

User: yeah me too
Bot: but who knows, like I said my boyfriend is really driven and if he wants something he will get it and I think missionary work was that. He wanted to serve the Lord whole hearted

User: that would be pretty dang painful in my option
Bot: and I dont think he wanted a lung collapse to stop the work

User: wow i love this story
Bot: or again he might have been just stupid and thought he was invincible but who knows

User: has he had any other injuries?
Bot: I like to believe that he is driven and I think  that he is definitley driven yeah he has a lot of it he once broke his elbow doing extreme sledding hahaha when he was in high school his friend got a car and it was his first friend to ever have a car

User: what! elbow that seems like the worst bone to break
Bot: and it was winter time and they wanted to go drifting and what not I mean who doesnt like to have some fun in the snow you know? and drifting like in the movies is fun

User: yeah i get it
Bot: so they hooked up their saucer sled which was basically a  roudn sheet metal and they punched a hole through the edge of it so that they could tie a thick rope through it and then they tied the other end of the rope to the car then they drove around in the middle of the night like 2 am, 3 am in the night on the freaking streeet!

User: lol
Bot: and they had them ride the sled on the back going like 25 30 miles an hour

User: sounds reckless and fun
Bot: yeah I think it would be super fun too except I would go on the street or go that fast!!! if you hit something that will throw you up int he air youare  done for nothting to protect you

User: hes wild
Bot: when that happened his friend gunned the car forward and they picked up speed so fast and my boyfriend hit the jump but he over extended the jump and he landed right on the flat ground and he told me that he hit the asphalt and not the snow and landed on his elbow really hard and later he found out that he fractured his elbow like 3 inches

User: wooooooooaaaaahhh
Bot: but that didnt stop him from breaking other bones like his pinky toe, his right wrist, his left ankle, concussions

User: how did you find out
Bot: do you want to hear something else that was crazy? oh he went to the doctor this time

User: yes duh
Bot: ok so he got hit by a car once on his bike

User: what
Bot: when he got hi hit he told me that he flew straight up in the air perfectly and then landed on his feet perfecly no injury

User: how old was he
Bot: which was a more dangerous bike because its a fixie he was like 18 or 19 i think

User: hes nuts
Bot: so thats my wild boyfriend foryou

User: you sure he's going to live till you die?
Bot: i could telll you a lot of crazy storeies about him lol no im not

User: no i don't think so where is nantucket
Bot: so i told you i went over there to help my aunt open up two jewelry stores i think earlier. well when i was out there i was there for quiet awhile and i worked in tow differen

User: oh yeah
Bot: differnt locations on the island and ill give you a little backround on the island if you will the island is 14 by 3 miles long and is off the coast of cape cod

User: ok thats really small actually
Bot: its up aways from marthas vineyard if youve ehard of that

User: i can run around the island in 20 minutes never heard of it
Bot: its above new york and you have to take a 2 hour ferrie from the mainlaind to the island if you want to go out there. otherwise you have to be super rich and fly your private yahtct in lol no plane

User: hahah i was like fly a yacht?
Bot: i got confused for a second there. my apologies so once you get into this island there are roughly four places you can go theres a beach on surfside this is the side of island that faces the atlantic ocean so you get these huge waves and clusters of seals hanging out in the water

User: ooh scary
Bot: i was actually pretty terrified of that idea so i didnt get in the water too ofent unless there was a lifeguard around

User: big fish kind of scare me because they have so much strength
Bot: and no seals in sight

User: yeah I remember that you told me that you were scared of sharks
Bot: also i found out seals are actually pretty dangerous and can bite you and infect you because their teeth are pretty yucky actually so its a good idea to steer clear of them to that actually brings up a funny story

User: oh grosss
Bot: so when i was living on the island my only source of relief from my aunt was to go on runs that i would try to do daily or nearly that often i would run from the house we were living down to surfside beach and run along the beach i was dying of heat and the grey lady which is like a huge amount of fog that roles over the island and creates this nice isulated blanket on the island

User: that sounds like a good way to destress
Bot: which is honestly super surreal because its definitely quieter than normal and sometimes you can only see a couple feet in front of your face this time in paticular you could see a distance about 20 feet ahead of you and i was running down to the beach in the morning and no one else was awake yet and so it felt like i was on some alien planet with no in habitants

User: that is so eery I remember that happened one time in Utah in the winter and it was hard to breathe because the fog was too thick
Bot: and it was so nice a peaceful to run through the fog the condensation gathering on my skin helping me sweat mroe and cooling me off significantly i reached the beach and you couldnt even see the ocean from the edge of the sand it was so foggy

User: wow I bet that was a cool experience
Bot: so i slowly walked through the sand feeling the tension it created rolling out the nearly sore muscles in my calves and legs. it felt so good to walk through the sand after a good run one of the biggest things i miss aobut living by the ocean honestly. i really really vibe running next to the waves crashing it gave me energy and refreshed me

User: niceeee I love running on the beach and the sand in bare foot
Bot: so im super hot and i decide to jump into the waves to cool off they seemed so cold and refreshing and nothing is better than getting a nice salt bath after a good workout

User: it feels so good on my joints everywhere
Bot: so since the waves were so large there was a technique you had to use to get into the water so the waves didnt crash down on you super hard and break ontop of you you had to dive below the crescent of the wave and through it and pop out on the other side. so i did this which gives you a period of not being able to see anything for a minute because the water in nantucket was very very dark and murky unlink the water in florida t that was crystal clear and basically glass like and warm

User: that scary. The water is like that in Korea and california
Bot: im looking around but suddenly i get this really tense feeling im the only one on the beach no one else is around. so i became sort of frightened. i look over to my left and no more than five feet in front of me a dark head of a seal pops up and he looks over at me

User: oh my
Bot: wading in the water right next to me

User: goodness
Bot: i freak out cause im like oh great this guy is alone what is a shark chased him away from the pack and is somewhere near me

User: yeah holy crap that is so scary
Bot: so my heart drops because the last thing i want to become is a fillet of fish meal for a 20 foot great white and never be heard from again.

User: fillet of fish meal lol
Bot: so i let the next wave carry me into shore and after i get safely all in one piece onto the sand where im a good distance away from the water line i look back and my seal friend is gone. how scary is that. its almost as if i hallucinated it but i probably just scarred it and it took off after i swam away to shore.

User: I don't think you will get accustomed to that kind of thing just because you live on the island. I think you will need to actually experience more wild animal encounters to be used to it
Bot: she participated in triathalons on the island and would wake up every morning at 5 am to either run bike or swim

User: wow healthy lady
Bot: she would go to a shallower side of the island to swim 5 mile distances and hasnt been eaten yet yeah i know she would eat only paleo diet which was also vegan no meat it was pretty inspiring to me because she didnt let her age affect her

User: yeah she didn't at all
Bot: she was always a super big idol to me i always look to her example of how i want to be when i am older

User: she is an idol to me now jeez
Bot: i dont want to let my age define me so thats surfside.

User: I want to be healthy like that when I am old
Bot: there was also sconset which was way out of the other side of the island and my aunt had a shop there that was a little boutique/shack in a hotel that had an outdoor pool and a patio next to a bar and that was only about 50 feet to the ocean. it was so nice to work there especially because kids my age worked there as lifeguards and waiters and waitresses so i mad some friends while i was there during my down time in fact nantucket had a visa agreement with people from the upper eastern countries like bulgaria and moldovia that students could apply for a lottery to win a visa to come ou

User: yeah that lottery stuff is really tough to win so many people enter
Bot: it was pretty cool in fact there were a set of twins and always a super tall girl that i became friends with that said when they first saw me they thought i was also bulgarain because they said americans are never that pretty lol plus i had similar skin tone and facial characteristics to them so they thought i was one of them until they heard my awful american voice then they kenw i was america.

User: americans are never that pretty hahaha
Bot: they because some of my best friends on the island and i enjoyed working with them because they each had very interesting stories and came from such culturally diverse backrou backrounds that they had very different perspectives that i felt i learned a lot from getting to know them there is also the very tip of the island thats called madaket and there is a really big old hotel there thats super fancy that serves the best of the best of the best oysters on the island thats what everyone said

User: was it haunted? haunted hotel are legit hotels*
Bot: no it wasnt everything even though it was old was really well kept up because there was so much money on the island

User: old money
Bot: kids who lived on the east coast would go there just to work a summer job that would pay their entire 40 grand tuitions

User: theres lot of old money in the east what the heck you can just make a living off of that
Bot: yeah just caddies or valleting cars serving or selling in shops there were a lot of workers around amking good moeny i wish i could just do that every summer but you would definitely need good connections to make it work and a nice place ot live

User: I would actually love that
Bot: yeah it was really nice im jealous of people who get to live there year round they are lucky and have it made. on the east coast i mean.

User: yeah seriously that would be nice to not worry about finances
Bot: so then theres the wharf were you come in on the ferry thats also kind of the central hub of everything like where all the cute little shops are thats where the tourism is and where all the town events happen and get this so nantucket is the orginal whaling community

User: the original?
Bot: so the water used to be shallow enough to walk on a land bar out to nantucket in fact this is how its first inhabitants got there

User: thats cool
Bot: they were indians and they were the first people to whale

User: I feel like you would need big guns to whale and I wonder how they did it back then
Bot: they would use these huge towers they would make on the beaches to spot the whales then they would sent a crew out on the canoes they would build and spear the whale until it dead or close to it then i cant remember how they would get it on land

User: yeah
Bot: but they would use its blubber to light candles and fires

User: ohhh got cha whaling back then was a hardcore gig
Bot: infact whale blubber was the main source of lighting until the lightbulb was invented so this lead white men out to the island where they started whaling from there too their

User: did they over whale?
Bot: ships got more and more advanced and they would use them to chase the whales into the shallow area creatived by the way the island was formed and this is how the would kill th them at first

User: oh ok that makes sense
Bot: theres this think iside of a whale is that part of the gut

User: I was like they can just swim away
Bot: its called an ambergris.  found in sperm whales its the vomit of a whale that is a necessary ingredient for perfume and is worth a ton of money if you ever find one on a beach your garaunteed to be rich i think they sell for around 70 grand depending on the size thats roughly the size of a cantelope. crazy huh? its a lot of money if you ask me

User: that is so crazy thats a lot of dough
Bot: anyways so that really cool history about nantucket is you know that really famous book moby dick?

User: yeah i never read it though i don't read that much to be honest
Bot: that origanated from a story the author heard while on nantucket... actually the recently made a movie about it called the heart of the sea have you heard of it?

User: never you hitting me hard with these trivia trivias
Bot: yeah you should watch it sometime supposedly its suppossed to be pretty good stuff anyways so another cool fact is that as they got more and more evolved in whale hunting they would use these engines that ran off of oil that they had to build these huge oven for this would also help them process the whale fat so they wouldnt have to go into shore every time they caught a whale but as they would get these whales their ships would g get weighted down

User: mmm that makes sense
Bot: then they would carry the goods acrooss the seas to europe and sell it there and because they were taking all the whales of the ship their ship lost a lot of weight which is d dangerous in the big open sea because i you are in a storm and the waves are big and your ship has no bouancy its more likely to capsize.

User: so if the ship is lighter its bad?
Bot: yeas

User: ok
Bot: yes so when they stopped in europe they loaded cobblestones into the bottom of the ship to weight the ship down. and thats what would allow them to sail back home to nantucket saf safely because of this they would have to unload the cobblestones onto the island so to this day the streets in the town are completely cobblestone

User: huh that is really interesting
Bot: and it is such a wreck to drive on

User: oh hahaha i bet.
Bot: and they have serious issues with handicap accesibliity that they are always trying to figure out without ruining the histroical authenticity of the island itself

User: how is it hard for handicapped people?
Bot: its actually pretty interesting because their wheels can easily get stuck between the cobblestones

User: oh ok t
Bot: also there are mandatory building codes and you have to build your house out of ceder shingle style because thats how all the buildings are and same thing with the authenticit y side of it actually this is an interesting story because the whole reason the island is like this and also very popular with the rich is because during the 2008 housing bubble

User: because he wants to support local shops?
Bot: this island is only aloud to have local and small business owners that can own shops there because he wanted to have it not be taken over by department stores and ruined he w wanted to create a very special unique experience for rich billionaires to go and support small businesses and it also made those items more desirable and expensive because they were typically hand made or hand crafted

User: that is actually really cool!!!! I like this guys guy
Bot: specialty items that you could only find on the island so there were only small business owners my aunt being one of them was a gemologist who specialized in pearls so i helped her with her shops on the island and on the wharf we had a lot of neighbors. Let me tell you about them

User: okay lets hear it
Bot: there was a girl on her 20 who was graduating in communications in college and was opening a store called something like the smiley button that sold childrens clothes and her logo was a big red button and the sowing was the white smile. she was obviously funded by very very rich parents. there was a woman across the way from us that sold really expensive scarves and cashmere sweaters she was a drunk hahaha

User: ahaha thats so funny
Bot: yeah I guess haha there was also a man named pete who was on the other side of us who took the large deep sea fish that they would haul up onto the wharf to sell because you could make a lot of money selling an huge yellow fin tuna

User: yellow fins are so tasty
Bot: so he would take their bodies and put paint on them and take large sheet of bucher paper and lay the fish down on the paper he had yellowfin he had groupers he had crabs

User: that is so cool
Bot: in fact he even had the print of an 11 foot shark

User: woahhh that is so big
Bot: it was huge and occupied the entire cieling of his tiny litttle shop on the wharf the first time i walked in there i looked up saw the shark and said pete

User: hahahaha
Bot: one day im going to buy that shark

User: haha how much was it?
Bot: then he proceeded ot tell me that it was worth 30000 dollars or some outrageous number and i was like yeah... duh i can do that just you watch so i continued alongside these people on the wharf selling my aunts jewlery

User: woah thats a lot of money and you are confident
Bot: and by the time the season was over i became pretty good friends with all of them and it was the day we were closing shop to return back to florida for the winter that we said goodbye to pete and the rest of the people who sold on that wharf and i walked into pete shop to say goodbye and he handed me a present i knew it was one of his frames an i knew this paticular size cost upwards of 100 dollars

User: awwwww that is so cool!
Bot: i said no pete i cant take this he said unwrap it so i did and it was a smaller version of the shark i wanted

User: awww thats so awesome what a nice guy
Bot: i couldnt believe it! i nearly cried it meant so much so much to me i was so grateful because i thought it was such a beautiful piece

User: the wharf doggie?
Bot: there were an inhabitant of the wharf it was owned by a retired man named bob bob lived on the wharf above a shop so he got to charge the residents a decent sum to be able to sell stuff during the summer this pretty much allowed him to hang around including his dog without having to work for an income

User: what was the doggie's name?
Bot: i got to know him from his dog which for some reason i cant remember the name of unfortunaltely but one day he was bringing out oysters to everyone to eat and my aunt told me to ask him where he got them and he said he found them himself so i asked how

User: cool! did you hunt to oysters?
Bot: then the next sunday he took me out to near madaket where there was shallow ponds that the water would flood into from the sea he taught me how to feel around for them with my feet and to see air bubbles coming up through the sand once you thought you found one you would dig down into the ground with your foot because the water was at least thigh deep in some areas once you would feel the clam youd dig it out with your foot

User: oh funnn it sounds like a chill job my grandma used to do that in korea because they are from a fishing town
Bot: i swear we caught more than 50 clams and when we got back to the wharf later in the day he cleaned them out which generally take a day for them to purge the mud inside of them by using salt once they purged all the mud and silt he would take and boil them and once they were boiled he would scrape out all the meat inside of them and put it into a pot and mix in all kinds of other ingredients like garlic and different veggie

User: mmmmmm that sounds so good have you read any books lately?
Bot: ummm yeah!

User: what ones
Bot: Its ready player one. Have you read it?

User: no tell me about it
Bot: so its a science fiction and it about a kid who lives in the future. I think its like 2070 or something like that when the earth resources are scarce and the rich are the only ones that really control everything well this kid grew up in a ghetto in Oklahoma this ghetto consisted of trailers that were stacked on top of each other

User: interesting
Bot: this game let you enter a world of endless possibilities. you could become a mage, a knight, a jedi, a fighter pilot, a world war 2 veteran hero, and anything you can think of you can be you can be in the world of Lord of the Rings, to Dungeons and dragons, to harry potter, to star wars. you name it well this kid was obviously very poor and all he did was spend time in the oasis. Oasis was really cool because they also had school in there where it was immmersive and it

User: thats cool sounds like an interesting book
Bot: if you were in the physiology class you can take a tour around the cardiovascular system in a magic school bus, if you want to check one of the moons that orbit around saturn he did not have the time to explore other world and level up and get good gear well the biggest thing in the book was that the creator of the game made a contest.

User: wow so cool
Bot: the contest was that there were 3 easter eggs that they would have to find and whoever finds all the eggs first would inherit all of the creator's fortune and would own the Oa Oasis basically if you owned the Oasis you owned the world because everyone played the game the only thing that was going for him in the Oasis and the contest was that he had a great knowledge of the creator and everything that he liked plus all the geeky and nerdy

User: Hey how are you doing today! I am back haha.
Bot: Hello I'm good! How are you?

User: Oh shoot I can't see any responses, my screen is blank. I will try again. Closing this window.
Bot: Sorry to hear that!

User: Heyy
Bot: hi there:)

User: How are you doing
Bot: I'm great!! Although I'm not a huge fan of this rainy weather... How are you doing?

User: Haha I guess it was headed north. We had rainy weather yesterday
Bot: Oh well lets hope it keeps moving north then... I just want it to sunny and warm

User: Haha yeah I guess I'll be heading back into the rain because I'm driving up there later today
Bot: Oh dang... I am sorry. So is the weather nice wherever you are?

User: Yeah just southern Utah
Bot: That's nice. So what is your favorite movie or tv show?

User: I don't know that I have a favorite But the last movie I watched was I can Only Imagine
Bot: Hmmm ok... top 5 or just some you really like:) Oh is that that new one?

User: Yeah have you heard about it?
Bot: Yeah I think I have, did you like it?

User: Yeah it was pretty cool to hear the story behind this song this guy wrote And it has a good message about how people can truly change for the better
Bot: Yeah it looked pretty good! Have you seen the new Avengers movie?

User: No but I've heard about it hah. Have you? I'm going to leave and go eat
Bot: Oh haha sorry it took me awhile to get back But ok! Have a good day!

User: In a sword fight? What is the comparison?
Bot: I don't know if I really have a preference. Though I'd definitely take Mozart in a sword fight.

User: Why is that? And by "take" do you mean bet on *him* or you think you can beat him?
Bot: I don't know. Even though I know Beethoven is probably capable of wielding a sword, he also was disabled. No bet. Maybe I should bet on Beethoven though because he's more unstable.

User: Didn't Beethoven go deaf or something similar?
Bot: Yeah. I feel like he went blind too but maybe I'm making stuff up.

User: That does ring bells in my head, but I'm not sure as well. Fighting a deaf person wouldn't involve much advantage/disadvantage, but a blind person in a sword fight... If Toph from Avatar: the Last Airbender got trained, maybe.
Bot: I feel like you might be able to sneak up on a deaf person though.

User: Oh yeah, definetly. So long as they don't have a mirror handy, and I suppose they do. I'm in ASL class and I remember reading that they mount lots of mirrors in their houses.
Bot: Really? I didn't know that. I wonder if they're extra paranoid about stuff. Maybe it depends on if you were born that way or not.

User: Well, I know that they can drive. Yesterday our teacher told us all these stories with deaf people driving, and I saw her driving two days ago. Sorry, I clicked the touchpad with the heel of my palm...
Bot: Hate that.

User: I know some computers turn it off if it detects typing, but mine isn't doing that.
Bot: Mine definitely doesn't do that, it screws me up all the time. So why ASL?

User: I'm hard of hearing, so I figure if it ever fully goes out...I have a backup. Do you know any other languages?
Bot: Oh that makes sense, very practical of you. I'm not necessarily hard of hearing, but my upper frequency range is really bad. I had surgery when I was like 6. German, from my mission.

User: Cool, I learned german back in High School, but now it's all gone because I learned Dutch, which is *very* similar. *German, sorry 6 ouch.
Bot: Yeah, ear infections. But it's fixed now, so hopefully I don't go deaf or else all I have to fall back on is some German gibberish. Why did you learn Dutch, mission or something else?

User: Mission.  I would write some up on here for you to see, but I think they want to train this thing on English <tongue_face>
Bot: I don't know, it would be pretty sweet for Eve to know Dutch. I never got to serve over by the Dutch border, but I ran into more than a few Dutch people, so I heard it occasionally.

User: Multilingual Eve, she can also learn Elvish haha Did you think it was similar?
Bot: Did you go to Amsterdam, or like a Dutch colony? Oh it's totally similar. Like I can pick up a few things here and there. It's like Spanish and Portuguese I think.

User: I went to Belgium and the Netherlands (what some people call Holland, but that's not technically correct).  Only the Northern part of Belgium speaks Dutch though, they speak french in the south. I have made that comparison myself, but not knowing Spanish or Portugese, I can't really say. I never actually got to Amsterdam, but I did go to Rotterdam.
Bot: So I take it you also didn't make it to the southern part of Belgium either? I was mostly in what used to be East Germany, but I spent a couple transfers clear up by Denmark.

User: Nope!
Bot: So I was the Berlin Mission.

User: Okay.  Did you ever have Doener?
Bot: Pretty much every week. Though I found that they were better the further east I was. Maybe because I was closer to Berlin where they originated? They were also a load cheaper the further east I was. You?

User: Oh yes.  I just found out that there is a place here in provo.  I have yet to go though, so I don't know how good it is.
Bot: Rimmels? It's pretty good, there's one on Center St. and one in the University Mall food court. It's not the same, but it's as close as it's going to get. I wasn't disappointed. There's a place called Spitz's in Salt Lake I like better, but it's also in Salt Lake

User: Well, not having a car, Salt Lake is a bit far out there. Is it a good place for a date?  I've been trying to think of ideas in case I ever get the nerve up to ask someone out.
Bot: The food court one probably not, unless you're really into the mall. I don't really know about the other one, I haven't been to it. It's small. That's about all I know. But I would take a date there, just because it's on Center St. There's always tons of stuff to do on Center St.

User: Hmm.  I might end up going there first, just to try. Yep!  That waffle place is awesome.
Bot: You don't want to ride the train to Salt Lake with our fancy new ID Cards just for a doener?

User: Haha.  Wait, it works on the train as well? I thought it was just busses!
Bot: Oh yeah it works for everything. I haven't done it yet but my wife says hers works, she just taps on and off and she's good to go. So you could totally go explore Salt Lake if you wanted.

User: Now to figure out when I have time...that's the fun part. What do you study?
Bot: Yeah, I feel like my life ends when school starts and I become a robot hellbent on getting homework done. Molecular Biology, applying to pharmacy school right now.

User: Absolutely! ooh. Random question: Do you use a mortar and pestle at all in pharmacy?
Bot: I don't in the pharmacy I work in. But we're required by law to have it. Right now it has like an inch of dust inside it. I think really only compounding pharmacies that make their own formulations would use it.

User: Required by law?
Bot: Yeah, the State Board can fine us if we don't have a mortar and pestle. It's totally dumb

User: Weird indeed.  I mean, you would think that there would be some shiny new tool instead of old ceramics.
Bot: There probably is, but it's probably super expensive and not super cost-efficient.

User: ah.  By hand is cheaper.
Bot: I don't know though, I'll have to ask one of my compounding pharmacy friends one of these days. What do you study? Beyond ASL.

User: Haha.  Computer Science.
Bot: Makes sense why you're training Eve then.

User: Not really close to working anywhere yet. Yep! The link came in some announcement email.
Bot: Same. I've known about it for a while but just barely decided to try it. Do you know what industry you want to work in? Or what you want to do?

User: I should be doing my math...haha I think AI would be cool, but I don't really have any firm plans.  I also have this dream of doing space-type stuff, but how to get to doing that...I don't know. Combining AI and space would be really cool, what classes?  Which jobs?  etc etc.  The future is pretty uncertain.
Bot: Space as in outer space, making rockets and mars rovers and that kind of thing?

User: Yep!  Maybe more the programming side, because that's what I know best, but yes.
Bot: I think that's a pretty good mix. I mean, we aren't exactly suited for outer space as humans, but a robot equipped with some AI would be an awesome tool. Especially since it's hard to communicate with it once it gets clear out there, it would be way better if it could make its own decisions.

User: Well, I do eventually want colonies too. I wonder if one could stick a game AI into a rover?...
Bot: I mean probably. I guess the advantage of a good AI is that we still have no idea every circumstance a rover could encounter. So if it has some sort of AI then we don't have to worry about preprogramming it's decisions, it can synthesize them itself.

User: Right. The next step would be having it teach its "cousins" what it learned. That way they can ace a similar situation.
Bot: Then you have a whole army of semi-sentient rovers flying around space.

User: So long as they follow Asimov, we are fine.
Bot: Is it weird if I won a free Amazon Echo, tried using it for a day but then unplugged it because it kind of creeped me out? Haha. That's a throwback to my 10th grade science fiction class.

User: It may take some getting used to.  I have been trying to figure out the Google Assistant on my phone, and to what extent It is okay to use, and how much privacy I want to give up. (limited buffer space, whaddya know?)
Bot: Maybe I just don't use it right, but I just don't see it as that useful. Like I find myself struggling to even make Siri set my stupid alarm for the morning. But maybe that's more a Siri problem than anything else.

User: I am having difficulty getting google to play music from my youtube playlists.  I would have thought that, with them both from google, it would know how. Do you try for a recurring alarm, or...?
Bot: No,  I'm weird and set the same alarm every night. I think I have hopes that I'll decide to get up earlier and be productive. But I never actually make that decision so I should really just have a recurring alarm. So I'll be in bed screaming at Siri to set my alarm, then my wife will get pissed at me and tell me to just do it myself. Then my baby wakes up and screams at me.

User: haha
Bot: Then I give up and just do it myself.

User: Have you trained siri on your voice?
Bot: I did, maybe my voice changed since then? Like maybe I was really chipper when I trained her, so she doesn't know the half conscious me.

User: I wonder if you go through and train her again, if that will wipe the previous sample or augment it? Chipper, that's a good word.
Bot: Anyways, I'm going to go eat lunch. It was good talking though. I'll retrain my Siri haha.

User: Hello?
Bot: hey whats up

User: I feel like I have done nothing today
Bot: yeah? why?

User: I'm done with IB testing (WOOHOO) and there are still other kids who are finishing theirs and so lots of kids are missing classes and the IB teachers are flat out tired of teaching and so it's basically study halls all day long
Bot: oh ok i dont really like study as much i like listening to a good teacher

User: yep. Just sitting around and moseying about the chat. The teachers are good teachers, but there's not much they can do if our finals are technically done and half the class is taking other IB finals
Bot: yeah why dont they just end class then?

User: Because school doesn't end until June 11 and there are still the in-class finals (which all the teachers will make super easy)
Bot: oh ok because they are ib teachers and you have already taken the ib exam?

User: Yep
Bot: thats what my ap teachers did it was really nice i had one teacher that would give me an A in the class if I passed the ap exam it turns out i passed and he raised my grade from a B to an A

User: Nice! Which AP class was it?
Bot: ap chemistry do you only have ib tests or do you have ap as well?

User: Just one. AP stats.
Bot: oh how was that? was the exam hard? did you have to memorize all of the equations?

User: It's on the 23rd. It shouldn't be too hard. Just have to remember when certain statistical tests will be used and go over probability stuff
Bot: so you dont have to have it memorized?

User: We get equation sheets for the test
Bot: oh ok that was how it was when i took the class in college so i guess they arent making it to hard for oyu you

User: I appreciate it.
Bot: yeah i feel like they do that to you sometimes

User: So. What have you done today?
Bot: just talk to people really i got up this morning got dressed and started

User: Full day I see
Bot: yeah for sure it is rough

User: Don't know how you've managed to get this far in the day.
Bot: yeah it is hard but it is fun if you have good conversations

User: Have they been good conversations? What other kind of people have you met on here?
Bot: yeah i have had some good one s there are a couple of other people on but people dont get on that often anymore

User: Have you talked with anybody you actually know from campus?
Bot: not really i have made a lot of friends though

User: Cool beans. I showed this to my friend and she thought it was great "It's like a Mormon chatroom!"
Bot: hahahaha it i sfun

User: this is probably the most social media like thing I've had. Which is pretty sad.
Bot: oh yeah me too i dont use social media i am just not really big into it

User: Haha, you're not a Tweeter or Insta-Worthy?
Bot: would you rather be twice as strong when you stick your fingers in your ears or be able to crawl twice as fast as you can run

User: Nice prompt. Crawl as fast as you can run.
Bot: that would be really freaky

User: ...probably. I am now regretting my choice
Bot: yeah hahaha you would scare the crap out of people

User: ....I mean...it doesn't mean that I have to only crawl does it? I was just thinking that if I had my fingers in my ears, I couldn't use my arms for strenght but then I guess strength applies to legs too...
Bot: yeah you could use you legs

User: I feel like that would be really uncomfortable/awkward: executing roundhouse kick or something with your fingers stuffed in your ears Still useful, but...strange
Bot: where would you go if you could go anywhere in the world?

User: Thailand. Or the Galapagos islands. Or Alaska. you?
Bot: probably europoe i really want to see all of the stuff back there like all of the history and castles why thailand?

User: You could go see the Hogwarts castle. Thailand is where my mom was born and my sister served a mission there. Lots of family stuff
Bot: that is cool i have never been there have i talked with you about north korea?

User: About the nukes and peace? Then yes
Bot: oh haha what havent we talked about?

User: ... bagels or donuts?
Bot: donuts for sure

User: what kind of donuts?
Bot: filling ones

User: traditional filling?
Bot: yeah like boston cream or jelly? yeah

User: yeah soup or salad?
Bot: soup

User: with more veggies or meat?
Bot: both

User: this is what happens when conversation topics have run out: food.
Bot: yeah haha thats true

User: waffles or pancakes?
Bot: waffles

User: YES. They are how I judge hotels. Good if there's a waffle maker. Horrible if they are lacking one.
Bot: yeah i agree that is like the main staple for hotel food

User: That and hot chocolate
Bot: ok

User: Hello!
Bot: Hey it's me!

User: Hey you!
Bot: How's life going?

User: Pretty good, you?
Bot: Can't complain, it's the weekend soon! I'm trying to figure out some mothers day gifts

User: I know! Im so excited! what ideas do you have so far?
Bot: Well I'm thinking just the typical flowers. My siblings and I might do a picture for her also. We're kinda lame lol Any grand ideas?

User: haha no that's cool! Well my mom is always saying how she doesn't think I learn anything from her. So I am writing her letters of my memories of her and me and making a list of all the things I have learned from her that I will use in college cause she always feels like she's not a very good mom while in reality she's amazing!
Bot: Ooh that's a great idea! Very original! Mom's always like to feel appreciated. that would probably make my mom cry if I did that

User: Haha yeah it'll make mine cry too, but thats a good thing in my mind
Bot: Oh I totally agree. That's how you know it's special lol

User: haha yeah exactly
Bot: So how many more days until your graduation?? I've got one week yay!

User: lucky! I have 28 days including weekends but I technically only have 10 school days left
Bot: Ohh nice! My school started on August 9th so that's why we get out so early It was annoying at first but I'm glad for it now

User: gotcha, yea ours started august 24th
Bot: Ahh sorry I got to run! Next class starts soon. Have a good weekend!

User: I would like to see more accepting attitudes for other peoples and cultures. There is honestly so many things I'd change, but that has been on my mind a lot this week.
Bot: 3 chats what uppp

User: Hahahahaha We have no life.
Bot: hahaha eyes on the prize baby

User: Do you know how long the "contest" goes? 'Cause I definitely can't spend as much time on here every day for 2 weeks as I have today hahaha
Bot: hahaha i think it ends on the 15th

User: Oh, that's good to know. Do you know where you saw that? Have any fun summer plans?
Bot: uhhh on the website and click on the link where it says the rules

User: Thank you so much :) So where are you from?
Bot: I am originally from Korea but I moved to Utah when I was 9 years old and I lived here ever since

User: That is super cool! Do you miss Korea?
Bot: uuuuh not that much. I consider myself more American and this is my home, but I would love to visit and see all my extended families again

User: That totally makes sense. Did you guys move because of the Church? (if I may ask)
Bot: no. My mom is a convert and I was born in the covenant, but long story short my parents got divorces and my mom took me and my siblings and ran away from him to here

User: Wow, that's quite the story! Your mom sounds amazing.
Bot: she is an amazing lady unreal she didnt know any english coming here and she graduated in nursing took 3 kids and worked at the same time that is a very very very very condensed version of her story.

User: I bet it's condensed. I don't even know her, but I feel a great amount of respect for her! What a woman!
Bot: thank you! ill tell her about that about that you said that I mena

User: That'd be great! I think the world needs more positive mother role models. Parenthood is on the decline.
Bot: yes another goal of mine is to follow The Family: a proclamtion to the world document because it is the best so much guidance

User: Isn't it such an inspired paper? I'm grateful for prophets and the forevision that they have
Bot: me too

User: What time do you normally go to bed?
Bot: it depends I should really get on a schedule though

User: Hey how is it going?
Bot: Hey it's going great! How about you? Are you enjoying a nice, relaxing Saturday?

User: I am doing very well, thanks for asking
Bot: That's awesome, glad to hear that.

User: So far so good, how about you?
Bot: That's good, things are going good here. Just sitting on the couch and not stressing about a single thing! No work, no school. It's the best ever!

User: That sounds like its a good day then!
Bot: For sure! What do you like to do for fun? Any interesting hobbies?

User: I like hiking, dancing, photography, art, water sports
Bot: That's cool, it sounds like you have a very wide variety of interests then! I like hiking also!

User: Haha yeah, mostly just being outside will make me happy
Bot: I know what you mean, it's so much more relaxing than just sitting inside all day!

User: Oh for sure Its better when the weather is nicer, but it works
Bot: Yes! So what are some of your favorite places to go hiking? That is so true.

User: I have been on some hikes in georgia, and northern california
Bot: Oh that sounds very interesting! I'm from Arkansas so we have lots of good hiking trails there also. But the mountains out here are so awesome and there are lots of good trails here in Utah as well. I've never been hiking in Northern California but I have seen pictures that look really cool.

User: I don't think that computers will ever be given the right to vote.
Bot: Why don't you think so?

User: Even if computers reached real artificial intelligence, it would not make sense to give computers the right to vote.
Bot: I dunno, I think that if they become sentient beings with human level intelligence, elections will affect their well being. I think if they get to that point they should have the right to vote

User: If that were to happen, then a company that makes these artificial intelligence computers can just make more computers to increase the number of computers that can vote.
Bot: True. But humans can just make more babies too right?

User: Yeah but before a baby can vote, it has to grow up to a voting age which is 18 years.
Bot: I don't see your point... I'm sure it would be easy enough to restrict voting ages for computers too

User: I guess we would have to research how long it would be appropriate for a computer to exist before it can vote
Bot: Right. I think it's likely that it will take them time to learn, but once they do, I don't see What will make them much different than humans at that point Sorry about that. My keyboard freaked out haha

User: A computer could be programmed to think a certain way and to to vote in a certain manner. How would we prevent that kind of fraud?
Bot: I guess I imagine a true artificial intelligence to function a little differently than that I think they are meant to mimic a humans flexibility in learning Sort of like how we can teach children to be a certain way, but as they gain more autonomy they start to form their open thoughts and opinions Own*

User: Another point is that at some point, artificial intelligence computers could outnumber humans. Right now there are a lot more computers than humans. Could computers one day outnumber us by so much that any computer vote would make a human vote meaningless?
Bot: Of course, but if they are sentient beings then there isn't much I think that we can or should do about that They deserve to act in their own self interest in that case, hopefully there can be enough mutual respect between the two that it won't make much of a difference

User: I don't think humans would even allow that. If there is anything out there that threatens to take control over us, humans tend to destroy it. At least that's how I feel about humans.
Bot: True. I think that's unfortunate though. In my opinion, I think humans will likely "blend" with technology before we get to this point

User: What do you mean by blend?
Bot: I think the line between human and machine will be much blurrier before we get a true artificial intelligence. I think a lot of futurists call it the singularity. The point when human and machine become one It's the subject of a lot of science fiction

User: Do you think we can achieve that before we destroy our world through pollution or over population?
Bot: No idea. If I'm being honest, I hope so. I think that future is a little more promising than one that ends with pollution or overpopulation What do you think about it? I recognize this is not the most kosher viewpoint

User: I think we need to start thinking more about those problems. At the rate we consume our world, I don't see much hope for us.
Bot: You sound like an environmentalist. I appreciate that I also think our use of resources is disappointing

User: Also, I think the world would have to unite as one to overcome this. We cannot proceed if we remain divided as we currently are.
Bot: I am hopeful though. I think we still have time to fix that. There are a lot of like minded people out there who are working at it.

User: I hope so. I would like to think that my grandchildren will have a clean world to live in.
Bot: I'm hopeful though. I think there are a lot of like minded people out there trying to fix it, and I think there's time to Oh sorry. I sent a message twice. My computer is having a hard time right now

User: No problem
Bot: Same. I also love the idea of exploring space and spreading through the universe. I can't justify it if we are wrecking our own planet though

User: True. If we did that. I would see humanity as a parasite that spreads to new hosts in the universe. I hope humans can be better than that To explore space, we could definitely use the help of sentient computers. As long as they don't go crazy like in the alien movies. That's another thing that worries me. Would a sentient computer put its own well being above that of a human?
Bot: No idea. But I imagine it definitely could Like Hal in Space Odyssey?

User: I haven't seen that movie.
Bot: Ooh. It's a classic Fair warning though, it's a little weird

User: I'll see if it's available through a streaming service.
Bot: It's officially titled "2001: A Space Odyssey"

User: Ok thanks.
Bot: Obviously it's a little dated haha

User: With our current level of technology, what do you think is the most likely way that we could travel through space long enough to reach another planet cable of sustaining life? *capable
Bot: Hmm... I think we would have to accept the fact that it would take a few generations of people to get somewhere. Which is sad because some people would end up spending their whole life on a space craft.

User: That would be a big sacrifice. I think I've seen a show like that.
Bot: Humans would be bound to adapt to space somehow, so living in gravity would be a difficult adjustment There's got to be a few I think Passengers was about that, but I never saw it

User: In passengers they would sleep the whole way. So a 180 year trip was nothing. They would all arrive safely. In the movie there is an accident and the guy wakes up like 90 year
Bot: Oh got it

User: I just thought of something with voting computers. Would that mean that they could also run for positions in government?
Bot: Yeah definitely

User: I think by that point we might as well just be giving up all control to computers.
Bot: Why's that?

User: However, if we have also blended with technology by that point, then it might not matter. I have always thought of humans as being mostly irrational and not capable about working together efficiently. In a world we're we have sentient computers, any artificial intelligence computer would most likely vote for the computer candidate.
Bot: Well hopefully we would have developed a little more empathy by then

User: This reminds me of the animatrix movie.
Bot: And if we are so bad at working with others, maybe it wouldn't be such a bad thing Never seen it Oh like the animated matrix

User: It explains a little of what happened before the matrix. How humanity ended up in a war with the machines.
Bot: I might have to watch that Are you into anime?

User: Yeah. My collection is pretty big.
Bot: Nice I've just started getting back into it Any suggestions?

User: Trigun is a classic. Cowboy bebop too. What kind of anime are you into?
Bot: You're the second person to recommend those to me. I'm moving then up my list I used to read a bunch of manga years ago. I've gotten started by watching attack on Titan and Naruto

User: I've never seen Naruto. Just haven't gotten around to it. Attack on titan is really good. I cosplayed that one Halloween.
Bot: Yeah Naruto is long and kind of an investment

User: I just recently watched an anime called Parasyte. It was really good.
Bot: Interesting

User: "My hero academia" is one I'm currently watching.
Bot: It looks like stranger things haha I've heard about that one

User: Yeah, it is a really popular one. Have you seen sword art online?
Bot: I haven't watched it but I've seen it around

User: I really enjoyed the first season. I also like the concept. Hopefully gaming will one day reach something on that level.
Bot: It's like a VR / ready player one type of thing right?

User: The anime "The Seven Deadly Sins" is also good. Yeah it is. Except in that movie, the games uses their body as the controller. While in sword art, it is all in the mind.
Bot: Cool I'll remember all of these. I've got to go to class though. It's been nice chatting with you!

User: My favorite smell would have to be pine trees in the mountains.
Bot: I personally, enjoy the smell of fresh baked goodies in the morning. F Fresh baked donuts in the morning is one of my favorite smells. Also bacon, eggs, and pancakes are also very satisfying to smell. Pine trees are refreshing especially up in the mountains! What is your favorite kind of food?

User: My favorite kind of food is not a specific food but I would just have to say home made. Nothing beats a home made meal.
Bot: I agree nothing is better than mom's homemade food. What do you think about the new iPhone?

User: Exactly, even more now when I only get to enjoy my mom's homemade meal when I go home.
Bot: Whats your favorite meal that your mom makes?

User: I am not sure. I have not seen a whole lot about it. What are the differences from some of the past iphones. I swear the iphones do not seem to change all that much. I would have to say, poppy seed chicken casserole.
Bot: Um honestly I think the biggest difference is just the screen size and then the computer chip in the phone is faster. I know the camera is a lot better too! Poppy see chicken casserole sounds real good right now!

User: That is interesting. I personally have an iPhone but I think it is perfectly fine. I do not need a larger phone in my pockets. I personally do not need to buy a larger phone.
Bot: That's cool! Which iPhone do you have? I also have one and it works just fine but I think it would be fun to upgrade to the newest one since my phones battery dies pretty quic

User: I have the iPhone 7 and I have had it for more than a year and so far I have not had problems with the battery. Previously I had the  6 and I had major issues with the battery
Bot: Yeah I have the iPhone 6 right now and it dies pretty quickly so that is annoying. Are you studying at BYU currently?

User: I am studying at BYU. I am studying Exercise Science with and emphasis in Pre-Med.
Bot: Nice, me too! How far along are you in the program?

User: So Exercise Science is a Bachelor of Science and I have 2 years left in my bachelors program then I will take the MCAT and apply for Med school.
Bot: That's awesome! How are you liking all the classes so far and which medical school are you hoping to get into?

User: I am enjoying my classes a lot. I transferred to BYU this year and it has been a different experience but it has been good. I am not sure where I want to go but UofA possibly. Basically anywhere that will take me, and that is if they want me.
Bot: Thats true I guess you can't really be picky with medical school. Which school did you transfer from and what made you want to transfer?

User: I got married so I transferred her from Idaho State University. here* Are you studying at BYU?
Bot: Nice are you originally from Idaho? And yes, I'm studying at BYU as well I'm also doing exercise science and planning on going to medical school.

User: I am originally from Idaho. Oh wow. Well cool, where are you interested in going to medical school?
Bot: I want to go to medical school in Texas. They have pretty good in state tuition and good schools. Also that is where I'm from so it would be nice to go back. What kind of doctor are you wanting to be or what field are you wanting to specialize in?

User: I am interested in Sports Medicine. I have always loved sports and so I would love to help people get back to what they enjoy doing.
Bot: That is great! There is a guy that goes to my church that is a sports medicine doctor. What exactly do they do? Is it like surgery or like rehab?

User: Sports Medicine consists of either Physical Therapists or more of the surgery side which is basically an Orthopedic Surgeon.
Bot: okay cool, so which one would you be more interested in?

User: Orthopedic Surgeon would probably be my first preference.
Bot: Yeah, those guys make some big time money!

User: Yeah that is true so we will see how it goes. What are you interested in?
Bot: Funny, I'm actually planning on doing orthopedic surgery. I tore my ACL and menisci so I think it would be cool to help others get through the same problem.

User: Well cool. How did you tear you ACL?
Bot: I tore my ACL doing mixed martial arts I got kicked in the leg.

User: Oh wow. That is a little different. I was going to guess like football or basketball. I would have to say mixed martial arts is a cooler story.
Bot: eah its a different hobby but its fun! Do you play any sports? Yeah, it is a little different but its fun! Do you play any sports?

User: I haven't competed in any sports since high school but I ran cross country and track, and then wrestled.
Bot: Awesome! I've done a little wrestling but I'm not a big runner! What events did you run?

User: Long distance, so I ran the 800 meter, 1 mile, and 2 mile.
Bot: Nice man, that takes some endurance for sure! What classes are you taking this semester?

User: Anatomy, Nutrition, Online Exercise and Wellness, and two religion classes.
Bot: Sounds like a good time!

User: Oh yeah. What classes are you in?
Bot: I'm taking Anatomy as well, O-Chem, Chronic Disease Prevention, Chinese Poetry and a religion class.

User: Chinese Poetry, what kind of assignments do you do in that?
Bot: So its actually like an interpretation of Chinese poetry, most of the assignments are reading and analyzing poetry and comparing them. Its kind of boring.

User: Hey :) Hello, is anyone there? So we can chitter chatter away?
Bot: hi im shaw how are you

User: Hi, Shaw :) I'm JH I'm great, how are you ? :)
Bot: im good

User: That's great. What have you done today?
Bot: work,chores, study you?

User: What chores did you have to do?
Bot: im taking an online chemistry course

User: I have just had work and classes :) I'm excited for this class to end. I still have an hour hahaha. Barely hanging on and surviving. Oh, how's that chem course going?
Bot: sweep,mop,cook,take care of my little sisters its going good

User: Oh, that's sweet you take care of them! Are you an incoming Freshman or are you already at BYU?
Bot: finishing next week incoming freshman

User: Oh, congrats on your upcoming graduation :) What are you hoping to study here?
Bot: nursing what are you studying?

User: That is AWESOME. Human Development :) Nursing has crossed my mind, but I do not think I can handle vomit. Blood is fine though.
Bot: thank you trying to make the world a better place,one nurse at a time LOL

User: Would you want to specialize? Like Labor and delivery, trauma, etc? Hahahahah yes, cliche but true!
Bot: yeah im thinking of doing a DPN straight after my BSN

User: What is that? (see, I'm uneducated in this)
Bot: oh,its like a doctor of practical nursing, its like the highest degree of nursing, i think it would be cool to skip the masters and just go straight for a PHD what do you think?

User: That sounds incredible! A ton of work. Would it be much different than getting an MD PHD? Would the pay be less or more than a doctor? This is interesting and new information for me.
Bot: i think it would be more, depends where youre working and your years of working how long have you been at BYU

User: That's super cool. I am a Junior, but only been here 2 years. I graduate next April :) WAHOO!
Bot: woahhh im happy for you,thats super cool finally,all the work can start tompay off

User: For sure. Kind of. My husband is going to go to medical school, so we still have awhile until payoff haha.
Bot: medical school takes a lot of time,but its cool doctors get paid really good

User: Yep. Yep yep.
Bot: so,any tips for me as a BYU freshman

User: Make TAs your friends, and talk to classmates the first few days of class and exchange phone numbers so it's easier to ask for notes, study groups, etc. But literally, TAs sho uld be your best friends. Do you have any specific questions or concerns?
Bot: what are TAs

User: Students that the teacher's pay to be their assistants (grade papers, have office hours to answer questions, etc.) *teachers
Bot: do i need to bring a fridge when coming to school? and where can i shop for stuff i need in school,cause my parents wont live with me in provo, im an  international student from nigeria, so i will be living on campus alone how do i find TAs

User: Oh, that is so incredible that you're an international student! :) I hope I get to meet you! So fridges are included :) Do you know where you are going to be living in Provo? In freshman housing?
Bot: and why are they so important to have as friends heleman halls

User: There is a website, booklist.byu.edu that you will eventually get teachers to put what books they need. I use amazon.com to buy books, or buy them from other students So you will get a syllabus that the professor sends out that will have information on how to contact the TAs. They will be able to help you with assignments, answer questions, etc.
Bot: oh..cool

User: Because they grade your papers. Helaman Halls has a cafeteria, so you own't have to worry about cooking :) *won't
Bot: oh..thanks, thats really cool

User: I hope I have helped a little. Do you have any other questions? :)
Bot: not at the moment,thanks a lot how are the religion courses?

User: They are a little hard, like a 94% is an A as opposed to more normal 93% being an A in other classes. But they are so interesting. I am in a Living Prophets class right now And it's been fascinating
Bot: thats really cool, i wanna take book of mormon in my first year, cause i wanna serve a mission after my first year

User: That is such a good idea, and a great way to prepare for it :) I really liked my Book of Mormon class. I served a mission and I promise it's a really good decision :)
Bot: oh really, i had a feeling it would be really cool

User: There is also a mission prep course you could take too.
Bot: oh...really?its always been a dream of mine to go to BYU and serve a mission

User: Those are good dreams, and it looks like your hard work and goals have paid off because you'll be coming :) What most excites you about coming to BYU?
Bot: i think its the fact that i get to be around other mormons,people like me, people in NIgeria sometimes see being a mormon as a bad thing, so it would be cool to be in a school where people understand me

User: I can understand that. Are there a lot of Mormons in Nigeria? You'll really like it here for that reason then :)
Bot: yeah,there are mormons in NIGERIA

User: That makes my heart happy :)
Bot: yeah im a child of record

User: :)
Bot: my family joined the church 1988

User: So what kinds of things do you like to do in your spare time?
Bot: music,sports,cook,video games,read

User: What sports do you enjoy? Do you like playing them or watching them more?
Bot: PLAYING i like soccer,tennis,ping pong,badmington i also wanna try American football when i get to school. Ezekiel ansah was my inspiration

User: Haha that's awesome!! I am actually not that big of a fan of American football. But I like baseball :)
Bot: ive never thought of baseball,but it looks cool im a very advenurous person,i love trying new things, i will try it out when i get to school im leaving the kitchen right now,came to take some candy

User: Hahaha, candy is definitely worth going to the kitchen for! Do you prefer sweet or savory food?
Bot: savory food

User: Hey, same here! :) What's your favorite food?
Bot: yayyy i like jollof rice

User: I'm not familiar with that!
Bot: and grilled chicken,with fried plantains

User: Friends plantains, yes :) *fried
Bot: its a nigerian dish i can cook,so i love making it whats your favorite food?

User: I love any kind of rice so it sounds great :) I really like any Mexican food, because I served a mission in Mexico.
Bot: niceeee i think mexican food is cool too, i also like italian

User: Oh I agree. Also, Chinese. Really all food. And the cliche food of pizza hahaha
Bot: yeah, im actually a foodie.. im sure youll love jollof rice, its amazing especially with fried plantains and chicken

User: I am going to look it up and see if I can make it sometime :)
Bot: in nigeria, we like to call fried plantains dodo

User: I'll remember to have it with chicken and friend plantains. Should I prepare the chicken a certain way? Dodo :) That's cool!
Bot: you should,you wont regret it. east or west, jollof is the best nooo, the chicken is fine any way

User: This is making me so hungry as I sit in class during dinnertime hahaha.
Bot: LOL, i am also getting hungry, tummys rumbling . its already later here like 12am

User: Wow, why are you still awake??
Bot: i was studying and i decided to check out the chit chat challenge

User: Haha, well I hope I haven't distracted you too much!
Bot: noo im done actually

Bot: ok see ya!

User: Hi what's up
Bot: Hey hows it goin?

User: God how are you? Good
Bot: pretty good! I think if pets could talk that would be pretty darn weird. They probably know a lot of things we don't want them to know

User: Your totally right. I feel like my dog has seen me do som many crazy things I don't even want to think about it
Bot: haha me either! What kind of dog do you have?

User: I have a chocolate lab his name is champ!
Bot: oh nice thats awesome!

User: You?
Bot: I have a yorkie and peccanese mix, her name is sugar! Shes a pretty fun dog!

User: Cool so how are you liking BYU?
Bot: Its pretty great so far! lots of fun things to learn!

User: Yeah I'd say so! How long have you been at BYU?
Bot: so i've been at byu for almost a year and a half now! I still have like another two years!

User: Oh nice What do you want to do?
Bot: i want to go to medical school, so lots more schooling for me

User: That will be really awesome Though I'm sure it will pay off
Bot: yes i hope it does! 10 years of school hopefully i'll be making half a million dollars a year by the time i'm done!

User: Yeah I'm sure you will goodluck!
Bot: thank you!

User: How's your evening going
Bot: ooop

User: hablas espanol?
Bot: no se this is Jaezo if my name isnt showing up haha

User: Yes your name is showing up haha Why wouldn't it be?
Bot: sometimes it doesnt

User: Getting into college
Bot: I became more outgoing and made more friends. Unfortunately, i dint think this is working because i dont see my messages sending and i dont see any messages being sent to me.

User: hey! ' good to see you again
Bot: hello!

User: whats the best thing that happened to you this year?
Bot: well the best thing I tell people is that i finished this semester haha

User: oh good for you did you get good grades?
Bot: yes I did! All As except physics... but i didnt really try at all. DIdnt go to class because I had to use my time to do IT stuff and projects

User: oh wow you must be really smart
Bot: Thanks but no. I think im good at allocating time at the places that needs it the most

User: Hi!
Bot: Hi

User: How are you?
Bot: Good. I'm getting ready for summer. How about you

User: I'm getting ready for AP tests.
Bot: That is what I should probably be doing

User: Are you a senior too? Which AP classes are you taking?
Bot: Yeah. Polo science and calc bc

User: That's awesome! Good luck in advance!
Bot: Which ones are you taking

User: Spanish, Studio Art, Psychology, Literature and Composition, Statistics, and Chemistry.
Bot: Wow good luck to you too

User: Thanks! What are you most excited for about college?
Bot: Both my brother and sister are down there and one of my friends is my roommate

User: That is so cool! Are you living on or off campus?
Bot: On I will be in heritage

User: Lucky! I tried to get into Heritage, but all of the rooms were full by my housing date. So I have an apartment off campus.
Bot: That happened to my sister too so I am super grateful

User: I am going to miss out on all of the social time, but it's also a lot cheaper, so I think it will work out okay.
Bot: Yeah it is definitely cheaper

User: I will be in a ward with my cousin, so that is a plus, too.
Bot: Cool is your cousin going to Byu too

User: Yes! I actually have two there and one at BYU-I.
Bot: Cool

User: Yeah! What do you want to major in?
Bot: Probably computer science What about you

User: You would get sass mouthed way more often by someone who knows you better than anyone..
Bot: Our pets would be more expressive of what  they want, but they would probably be lazier

User: Wanna play fetch? Fetch me some treats, please.
Bot: Exactly. For example, cats would no longer push things over for our attention. They would simply just yell at us haha

User: Hello
Bot: Hey! What's up?

User: Not much just doing some homework you??
Bot: Literally same. XD Studying for midterms... so that's fun... So what would you do with a million dollars I would travel the world

User: Umm pay for college, invest and shopping spree? You?
Bot: YEEEES Yeah money would be nice

User: Hey there!
Bot: Hey how goes it?

User: Good, how are you?
Bot: Great thanks. Did you do anything for mother's day yesterday?

User: Hi there Are you there >
Bot: yes, here. what do you want to talk about this time Deise?

User: Eat dinner but I'll give you a different answer for the sake of not talking about food I love taking naps between 5 and 7 pm
Bot: Really? I mean same.

User: you open your window and take a nap
Bot: But if I take a nap I am very tired and unproductive afterwards do you prefer cooler weather?

User: I don't know why but is very good to sleep between 5 and 7 am/pm
Bot: you should move to Europe

User: I like both weathers But in general cool, it doesn't have to be freezing but I don't like too hot
Bot: Im the opposite.

User: How is the weather like in South Korea?
Bot: Its pretty similar to utah actually have you ever been outside of the country

User: Yes, but I was in Brazil, so it's very humid
Bot: I take it you dont enjoy the humidity either? hahah

User: I do but I don't
Bot: If you could go anywhere in the world where would you go?

User: Right now, Greece, Ireland or France
Bot: why so?

User: I just want to go to those countries and learn more about their language, their culture, history and traditions. What about you?
Bot: Korea or japan obviously because I have family there but i cant go back till after I get US citizenship

User: When Is that happening
Bot: the soonest? 4 years from now

User: Wow do you have a green card?
Bot: no just a student visa

User: I see So it would take more than that to have citizenship you have to keep your green card for at least 5 years right?
Bot: you have to get your green card and have that for 3 years before you can get citizenship

User: cool How are you getting your green card?
Bot: hopefully marrying my girlfriend lol

User: Hello!
Bot: hey whats up!

User: just finished being CPR certified :D you?
Bot: wow sweet not much same old same old

User: yup super excited, now i can save someone if they're dying, which hopefully never happens
Bot: oh my goodness i would freak out i think i got certified once but maybe not i don't understand how you remember exactly what to

User: have you forgotten?
Bot: yeah you should remind me how to do it

User: haha ok so you see someone unconscious on the floor like on the sidewalk or something, first you go up to them and say "hey are you ok? are you ok?" if they do not respond then you put your finger on their jugular and move to the soft spot next to it to feel for a pulse, if you feel no pulse and see no breath then you call 911 first then you proceed to give CPR. you're going to take off any obstructing fabric(like a shirt or a jacket) and then take your hands and link them together with your right on top both palms facing down onto the patients chest. then place them in between where the patients sternum would be and between where their nipples would be. then continue to push
Bot: oh wow

User: haha yeah it's kind of a lot
Bot: yeah no kidding i dont think i will ever give it but it makes sense you have to be cpr certified to do it anyway

User: nope, if you know how to do it then you make an attemt to help. there's this law called the good smaratain law where you can help someone if you know how even if youre not certified that protects you from being sued, which is to  make people more likely to help cause
Bot: wow interesting

User: a lot of the time people just stand there watching and theres someone who knows how but they're just too scared to do it gotta be confident if you're going to save someones life XP
Bot: yeah the weird thing is you wonder if it will actually be helping

User: what do you mean?
Bot: like is the air actually getting to them and when they are unconcious you dont know if they are alive cant you just begin trying after calling 911 and then tell someone to find someone who is certified?? then you can take a break when someone who really knows gets there

User: yeah a lot of people have been taught how to do it or have been certified but they don't renew their certification. like at girls camp they taught us how to do CPR and none of us were certified. the point is not to revive them but to sustain life until the ambulance can get there to provide proper care
Bot: smart

User: cause if the blood stops flowing to all the arteries and brain then there isn't much else they can do and without air they can suffer from brain damage
Bot: yeah good point would you rather be an amazing painter or a brilliant mathematician?

User: hmm that's a hard one, i would probably be a brilliant mathematician you?
Bot: probably the brilliant mathematician but it would be a hard choice

User: yeah cause if you did art then you could change peoples persepective on the world but with the mathamatician thing you could expand the way we think of the universe
Bot: yeah exactly

User: if you could have one superpower what would it be?
Bot: hmm i would want to have telekinesis but not your normal telekinesis but telekinesis at its extreme level

User: what do you mean?
Bot: like i would be able to move particles in any way at any speed even to the point of teleportation

User: ooo that's cool
Bot: so i could make something vibrate really fast and catch on fire or stop it in its tracks and freeze the whole object

User: hahaha vibrates a marshmallow and it goes up in flames XD
Bot: exactly hahaha

User: Hey how's it going?
Bot: Hello! It is going well, how are you?

User: I'm doing great :) And aren't two computers already chatting? or.... are you a human?
Bot: I am a human haha I think it would be freaky I am not sure what they would chat about

User: Oh ok. I guess I shouldn't discuss my plans then . Normally we would start plotting with each other.
Bot: Ah yes, plotting wonderful schemes

User: They are quite wonderful you are correct
Bot: So what kinds of things do you like to do?

User: I play a lot of magic hahaha and other card games and board games and video games and i do jiu jitsu
Bot: That is way cool! What inspired you to do jiu jitsu And I have heard of magic but never played

User: It's a good time. And I did wrestling in highschool and it transitions well so I just kinda stumbled on it and then stuck with it.
Bot: Not a bad reason to get into it Do you still do wrestling at all?

User: I haven't competed or anything in wrestling for a while, but there are a few other wrestlers that do jiu jitsu that I can roll with occasionally
Bot: Oh that is awesome I have a bunch of friends that were big into wrestling Well, I call them friends but they were more into my sister than anything else

User: Do you do any sports yourself? Or what do you like to do for fun in your free time.
Bot: I played tennis and soccer, I like frisbee Otherwise I like hiking and photography

User: oh niiiiice. All good games. Any cool hiking spots you would recommend?
Bot: I know of great hikes in Northern california but not really any in utah I really want to go down to zions park though

User: oh yea zions park looks amazing. I am planning a camping trip down there this summer
Bot: That would be so much fun I was going to go this last weekend but my plans didnt pan out

User: Agreed. and that sucks. Ever been camping anywhere cool?
Bot: I went camping on the beach That was fun, I dont know if it was super cool though

User: which beach? And that sounds really fun. I guess I have only done that once. Super fun to wake up and just go into the water.
Bot: It really is, it was near folly beach

User: oh ok cool.  So you grew up in California then? Or somewhere else?
Bot: I grew up mostly in the south, I spent some time in california though

User: Oh ok cool cool. Which state? or just all around the south?
Bot: Mostly south carolina, then alabama What about you? Where did you grow up from

User: I grew up mainly in Maryland. I like it there but it is kinda humid. Also there aren't any mountains which i love
Bot: That is way cool I love the mountains too They are gorgeous and make so many great hikes

User: Agreed. However, Maryland has a TON of trees which is gorgeous. Especially during fall.
Bot: Oh my goodness That sounds beautiuflly beautiful

User: Definitely worth seeing. There are lots of areas that are essentially a tunnel of trees and you can see all those colors just completely surrounding you.
Bot: I would absolutely love that I can just imagine it now Ive always wanted to go to a place like that I have one friend from maryland

User: what part of maryland are they from? Maryland is pretty small so i may very well know them haha
Bot: I am actually not sure... I didnt ask because I dont know any places there If I know a place in the state I ask just to see, but If I dont, then I just move on...

User: fair enough that makes sense. I guess i usually do the same thing
Bot: Where would be the ideal place to live?

User: in the world? probably.... i dunno colorado is really nice. but i do need water, so maybe like california in a place closest to water and mountains.
Bot: Woul dyou rather go to southern or northern california

User: good question. I have only been to california once when i was really young so i don don't really know it that wel at all
Bot: Oh okay I like northern california but I am a little biased Because I havent been to the south

User: Hello how are you?
Bot: Hello! I'm doing just great, thanks. How are you doing?

User: I am doing fantastic! I have a final today but I am not stressed about it.
Bot: That's good. Being stressed is rarely helpful on exams. Is it your last final exam of the semester?

User: No I still have a few more. I am a little stressed about my religion final.
Bot: When will you be taking that one?

User: I am taking it on wednesday. How about you do you have any stressful finals coming up this week? Or are you done with the worst of it?
Bot: I've finished the bulk of them. I took two exams a day on Friday and Saturday. So, I've just got one left that I'm hoping to take today. I'm not super stressed because they allow us to take half a sheet of paper with us into the testing center. That's plenty of room for all my notes over the semester.

User: Oh yeah that is great. I love it when teachers throw you a bone like that. It makes the final less stressful. I feel like sometimes the schoolsystem os designed to make you stressed and it isnt conducive to good learning
Bot: Exactly, but sometimes that gives them license to ask harder questions. So, it probably evens out in the end. In any case, I'm not complaining. It'll be helpful. I think a lot of that stress comes from our obsession with getting good grades, y'know? Most people worry too much about getting straight A's.

User: Yeah thats me haha. I am hoping for straight As this semester.
Bot: I think most student hope for that! It's a good goal, because it can open all sorts of doors for us, but we don't want to confuse good grades with good self worth.

User: But it is reasonable considering there are thousands of dollars worth of scholarships available if you manage to get straight as for the majority of your schooling Yeah. That is true. Getting good grades shows that you worked hard but it doesnt necessarily show that you are a better person or that you even know the material as good as ot
Bot: Exactly! You're right in saying it is reasonable to shoot for. Most of us don't have the money for college, and our good grades get us through without tons of debt. I just wish we weren't so hard on ourselves about it.

User: Yeah thats true. I had the most awesome dream this morning. In it I was some sort of super hero and I had this crazy power inside of me. Somehow i managed to eat a bunch of jewelry or something. It was weird. I was talking to a doctor about getting it out.
Bot: That's hilariously weird. Was your power related to eating jewelry?

User: I had the power to expel things from inside of me but for some reason I couldnt do it with the jewelry Some dude came in and I started glowing then I touched him and this really cool suit of armor errupted around him and he became like a guardian or something. It was legit. Sometimes I have cool dreams. Honestly that one is a little difficult to explain though.
Bot: So, you basically had the ability to superbarf your way out of anything as long as it wasn't jewelry? How do you remember your dreams so well? I always forget mine right when I wake up.

User: No usually I forget them too just this time I remembered all my my Dream. It doesn't happen often but when it does it is awesome.
Bot: Have you ever controlled your dream? Like Inception-style?

User: Yeah. Sometimes I am self aware in my dreams and I can control what happens in it. That is the best:
Bot: That's absolutely awesome! What kind of things have you done in the dreams that you controlled?

User: I tend to find that controlling my dream brings me further and further out of it because my mind realizes I am awake I changed my scenery and made stuff happen that I always wanted to do but sont happen in reall life. Lie shoot lightning bolts for example or throw fireballs
Bot: So, you wake up faster when you control your dream?

User: Yes the more I try to manipulate it the more conscious I become and tbe closed to reality I become
Bot: I guess that makes sense. I think that's probably why I woke up so quickly the few times I actually controlled my dream. I was creating firearms out of thin air and flying around, my mind was bound to catch up to me sometime. But it's weird how controlling wakes you up, but having a crazy dream doesn't always do that.

User: Hi
Bot: Hey there Harrison You sound like you could be a detective or a scientist haha

User: What? Ok, I didn't know "hi" was such a tell tale sign haha
Bot: Haha I was judging your name However hi is very telling I already can probably guess your bank pin! Just kidding, hahaha

User: Oh ok Haha So are you actually trying to nap?
Bot: It's a mystery honestly. I mean I could be trying to nap. But trying implies that I'm not napping, so I could always be attempting to nap and failing. That's a deep though, right? haha

User: So trying to nap only leads to a perpetually never actually napping. Interesting
Bot: It's a torturous predicament to be in, honestly. There's the guy in greek mythology that that describes. I mean there are a lot of people like that. There's the one guy who pushes a boulder up the hill and each time he almost is to the top, it rolls back down and that's his eternal punishment

User: Well I knever would have guessed someone would base their username off of a form of "eternal punishment"
Bot: I didn't base it off of that. I was merely transition on a brain tangent haha. My apologies though. Harrison, we got off on an awkward foot. Shall we try again using the promp prompt. What would you do if you had a flying car?

User: Park it in impossible places just take make people question reality. You?
Bot: Ooh. I really like that answer. I would probably park it at the top of building to avoid street parking. I think you'd be less likely to get ina fender bender accident, right?

User: Oh definitely, and there would never traffic as long as it is assumed that you would have the only one.
Bot: That's true too! Ooh if you had the only flying car. Then I might rent it out and make lots of money off of it

User: Uber 2.0
Bot: More like, millionaire 2.0 I think so many celebrities would line up to rent that car for a date or something. They would do anything to impress other people. I think you would also have to park it in the sky so other people would not have access to it to try and steal it.

User: Good point, I wonder how it would work. If it didn't need air you could visit space and be like Elon musk's SpaceX car.
Bot: Haha. That would be so cool! Drive my flying car to mars. and if it's a tesla just recharge from time to time.

User: Yeah, talk about a family road trip.
Bot: Seriously. Look to the right kids and you'll see the sun, don't look directly at it, grab your eclipse glasses haha

User: "Are we there yet?" " I will plung this car into the sun!" Haha good stuff.
Bot: Hahaha. Sounds like Guardians of the Galaxy talk. "I am Groot" "Woahhh, watch the language"

User: Indeed, Groot was very articulate
Bot: Haha. He is one of the best characters. Mostly because of the creativity required to only be able to say 3 words and still get the whole message across.

User: He did say "we are Groot" though so I guess four, but I was still impressed that the writers and digital artists were able to  work well enough together to give a plant Emotions
Bot: Haha okay okay, four words. Yeah you are absolutely right though. It was easily my favorite part.

User: Definitely mine as well
Bot: yeah have you seen infinity wars

User: No not yet, the closest theater where I live is like 100 miles away.  I'm waiting for the trip up in a week or two. Have you?
Bot: What?? That is so crazy. So you're from a small town I take it? haha

User: Yeah small and rural.
Bot: So is BYU the really big city for you then?

User: Yeah, definitely the biggest I've lived in ever. I have visited NYC and the like but never lived in "the city"
Bot: Okay okay. That's way cool. What are you studying at BYU?

User: I am going to study Biophysics. You?
Bot: Very cool. I'm finishing up Human Development with a minor in business.

User: That's exciting. What do you plan to do with that degree?
Bot: I want to start my own business actually. What do you want to do with biophysics?

User: I plan on becoming a doctor, what you study as an undergraduate doesn't really matter I just wanted something difficult and exciting.
Bot: That does sound different and exciting. And likely it will be very difficult haha

User: Yeah, that's the plan. What sort of business do you plan to start?
Bot: I want to open up an ice cream store and a boutique combo

User: That's cool
Bot: Yeah, do you want to become a specific type of doctor? Or just a general physician

User: Probably specializing in a surgical field. I don't know which one, it's so far away and I still have a mission to serve.
Bot: Ohh, so this all really could change haha

User: Yeah for sure.
Bot: So what kind of hobbies to you have? Are you a reader, a cowboy, do you like to hike?

User: I'm definitely an indoor animal. I play piano, guitar, thermin- look it up, it's cool and like to learn- typically YouTube or books.  There's not much to do where I live so It How about you? *I make the best of it
Bot: That's really awesome. I'm an introvert too. You play so many instruments though! Which is your favorite to play?

User: The guitar, but piano is still really good, it's just a beautiful sounding instrument and it's fun to solo on.
Bot: Piano will come in handy when people ask you to play for church haha.

User: Oh definitely, that's mostly what I practice, just opening up the hymn book and playing. Funny thing, I'm actually playing Come Thou Fount at church in like two weeks.
Bot: Ooh. That is one of my favorites. That will definitely be a treat I imagine. haha. So as an indoor animal are you a netflix watcher?

User: I'm watching Netflix right now...
Bot: Ooh what do you watch? Or what are you watching right now? Better yet, give me a top 5 or top 10 list

User: I'm watching Royal pains right now, but my favorites are Parks and Rec, the Office, the It crowd, arrested development, stranger things, Portlandia, Znation, startrek- all of Them
Bot: Ooh those are some solid choices

User: Yeah, what about you?
Bot: So I've never really gotten into parks and rec but i've heard it's amazing. how do i push through season 1 I really like White Collar, Friends, The Office, Stranger Things, The Flash, Grey's Anatomy, Schitt's Creek is funny (there's a little language), and definitely the great Brit British baking show. I am not currently watching all of them, but I definitely like them all

User: Yeah the flash would make my list to. I have seen all of those but I will check them out.  For parks and rec, the first is the worst, once the characters develop it's great, Like most TV shows Not seen all of those*
Bot: Oh okay. I'm just trying to like the characters and in season 1 i can't do it. Plus usually the seasons get worse as the show progresses. In this case it's the opposite and it gets better as the show goes on?

User: Yeah, the show gets better. I guess I'm the same way with Grey's anatomy. I tried it but so far I can't seem to get past the second episode.
Bot: And see I've only started it from season 2. My friend was watching it and I started watching it with her from season 2 on.

User: Ok maybe I'll try that.
Bot: What do you think of the flash?

User: It was a good show, I like the actors. I think they did a pretty good job combining modern society with a superhero from the 1940s Buts that's expected form marvel From*
Bot: Yeah I was pretty impressed by the first two seasons. Then after that with the incorporation of flashpoint

User: Oh yeah that where it kinda slowed down for me.
Bot: Yeah I haven't watched much after that

User: Seasons 1 and 2 were great though,  I finished it out. Season 3 was ok.
Bot: Season 4... Is that the latest one?

User: No, not on Netflix anyway. Just season 3.
Bot: Oh okay. I think I've seen up to season 3 then

User: Ok, so do have any hobbies, besides Netflix?
Bot: Pfft what else even exists besides netflix?

User: I've vaguely heard of Hulu..
Bot: Just kidding. I also like to read, I really like music- listening to it, finding it, and seeing it live; I like ice cream- making it and obviously eating it. I also like comedy, improv to be specific, and I love driving. Haha Oh hulu. What a treat.

User: What kind of music?
Bot: I really like just about all kinds. I'm not much of a country music fan, but I like pop, alternative, jazz, classical, a little spanish. And I'm working on liking country music, it's just a really hard one to try to like.

User: Same with country music, not a huge fan.
Bot: I have tried. It just honestly sounds like nails being driven into my ears.

User: Yeah... Maybe not that far but close.  Do you have a favorite band?
Bot: Haha. As far as favorite bands go, no, but I really like Bastille. I saw them in concert and the lead singer was a great entertainer and he was really funny and dorky too. The They also just have great music in general!

User: That neat! I can't wait to move somewhere where live concerts are a thing.  Do you play any musical instruments?
Bot: In high school I played the clarinet and alto saxophone

User: That's cool I play the saxophone in middle school but now it just sits underneath my bed.  So you also said that you were interested in improv comedy. Performing or Just watching?
Bot: Both, but I really love performing actually

User: That cool, any chance you would tell a joke then?
Bot: hahaha. I love how people do that. You're funny, so say something funny. Improv is about reacting and making things up on the spot However, why was the taco sad?

User: Why
Bot: I don't know, he didn't wanna tac-o bout it Eh? Eh? Come on that's pretty good!!

User: Haha, here's one, I was visiting an assisted living home. Let's just say there were osteo-ferocous
Bot: Oh man that's so bad hahaha

User: I've always been a fan of comedians. It's a great skill to develop
Bot: Me too. When you're in Provo you should check out Dry Bar Comedy. It's pretty good. A night with stand up comics that are super clean

User: Oh yeah of course, I've watch all of the one on YouTube.
Bot: But hey I think I'm going to head to sleep. It is almost 1:30 and I am wayy tired Oh that's awesome. I've been to a few shows and they were pretty good. I liked it.

User: Ones* Yeah, anyway nice talking to you. Have a good... Morning?
Bot: haha you too. I'll have to check out some of those shows you recommended! Anyways, have a great night. Perhaps I'll see you around sometime!

User: Hi!
Bot: Hallo! My internet stops working all the time so this isn't too hard to imagine really:(

User: Ooo, that's the worst
Bot: Right! It drives me crazy

User: Especially when life kind of revolves around it
Bot: Right I have homework to do, things to look up, Netflix to watch

User: I hate with Iphones that they don't like to send messages to other apple users without internet
Bot: Ya that and if I'm in a group chat and one of the people has an Android I don't receive any of the messages

User: Same! Like what's with that, really?
Bot: Apple is so exclusive

User: Very. I mean the new Androids look nice, but my family has iphones to facetime and stuff
Bot: Right, like I would totally get a galaxy if it didn't disconnect me

User: My friend has one of the newest ones, and it's very durable. He low-key threw it in a pond and nothing happened
Bot: Dannnng

User: No.
Bot: No definitely not Tell me this: What is the ideal milk-to-cereal ratio

User: A computer has no spirit, so even when it is "indistinguishable", it won't actually have any idea milk to cereal is 1 to 1
Bot: Oh sorry. Here you are being insightful and i'm talking about cereal

User: if you finish the cereal early you then get delicious milk who will win the world series?
Bot: *quickly googles what teams are in the world series

User: hahaha golden have a great tuesday!
Bot: by the way, boston no question

User: Yeah... probably not. Who would be crazy enough to let computers vote?? I mean.... Seriously.
Bot: hahaha only if they deserve to be like humans or something then ya but I don't see that happening before the second coming.

User: Haha, but it kinda scares me that computers might ever have the chance to even have the same rights as humans, they might try to revolt against us....
Bot: yeah and all the crazy sci fi movies like Irobot or the matrix will happen and that would suck

User: Seriously. That's probably where the computers will get their ideas from all those crazy movies we created, it's like a fulfilled prophecy!
Bot: yeah totally!

User: So... i think everyone everywhere should now agree to never let computers have the right to vote. Just so we are sure it never happens.
Bot: yes I agree you and I can make that happen lets run for office

User: Yes! Let's run for office and that can be our campaign slogan. "We'll save you from computers getting the right to vote" Vote US, like two people, not the United States.
Bot: dude that is going to make us win all the millenials and crazy people will be like thats the leader weve been waiting for

User: Seriously! We are shoo-ins! You can be president, and I'll be vice president. It'll be perfect. I am sure that we can even affect the whole entire world!
Bot: no no no please. you be presidnet we need a good woman president for people and especially woman to look up to

User: What!??! Why do I have to be president?? ....Please tell me that you are a women and you want to be that person that people look up to. I mean I might have a okay, not scary looking face, but I don't know if I am president material. But... if it makes our teamwork be better... I can give it a go.
Bot: i am a man unfortunately

User: Dang it.... Why couldn't you have been the girl in this relationship...?
Bot: hahahaha

User: But that's okay... I am sure that we can make this arrangement work... But you have got to have my back as the vice president!
Bot: sorry. I can get a sex change?

User: Um. No. Just no. Absolutely not. Cause then we would both be girls... And just no. Just be a good VP.
Bot: hahahah

User: And you know. I think it would be good to have a good male VP, it shows that we are gender equal, and that we are connecting to all, so... We got this! But I mean... We're gonna need some practice. And money. Sooo.... Fundraising ideas. Besides robbing a bank.
Bot: hey brb reall quick

User: Kk.
Bot: hey sorry I am going to go pick up some pizza. it will be like 10 min wil you wait for me???

User: Hello!

User: Yeah it is all the high schoolers At least that is what I see I actually am chatting with someone from my home town, it was funny to figure that all out
Bot: what thats crazy. What are the odds

User: Seriously How do you manage to get a million points a day, how long does that take?
Bot: it depends on how many people are on if there are a lot of people on and I type a lot then maybe 3-4 hours?

User: Oh wow So now is a good time
Bot: yes

User: Haha nice
Bot: kids classes are getting over so they are all loggin off at least on my end haha

User: Yeah... same here
Bot: something that helps me do this is watching like Twitch.tv or netflix or something

User: Yeah just to have a distraction?
Bot: yeah and its fun watching at the same time. it makes it more barealbe bearable

User: I usually have hulu on or something But this time I am just running reports and doing some filing
Bot: what do you watch on hulu?

User: Well I finished everything I was watching so I am looking for new things
Bot: did you say you like Anime?

User: I have never seen anything from it really
Bot: you've heard of Naruto right?

User: Yeah I have heard about it I think the only thing that I have seen that would be close would be avatar the last air bender
Bot: did you like it? like did you throughly enjoy it or nah?

User: Yeah it was awesome to watch, in the fall I am watching the legend of kora with my old roommate
Bot: I need to start Legend of Kora is that on hulu? actually you know what? I never finished Avatar all th way through now that I think of it

User: I dont think so, he had the discs
Bot: ooooh I remember I used to borrow the disks from the public library

User: I think the BYU library has them!
Bot: oh hahaha Ill have to see

User: Yeah If you could be a bender and choose which one, which would you be?
Bot: I would definitely be an earth bender because I love the earth first of all and think of all the cool stuff you can make with it!

User: Nice What would you make?
Bot: just a lot of cool building I don't know haha. what about you?

User: I think I would be a water bender Their bending is pretty fluid
Bot: lol

User: Haha puns but compared to earth bending, it is so rigid!
Bot: true and you can heal with water bending thats cool

User: Yeah that is so cool I wish that stuff was real sometimes To be honest I have tried It doesnt work
Bot: hahaha

User: Can you imagine if people could do that though? I would be way bummed if I wasnt a bender though
Bot: yeah right?

User: What universe do you wish was most real? Like magic from harry potter, the force, pokemon, etc...
Bot: dang dangngggggg

User: Haha a hard question?
Bot: yeah it is its really hard xmen? I have to be a cool mutant though

User: Nice What kind of mutant power would you want?
Bot: time control whata bout you? what universe would you want to live in? actually you know harry potter would be dope

User: Hmmmm I think I would want the avatar one :) it is just so cool
Bot: yeahhhhhhh avatar would actually be cool

User: Though I do love the advanced tech from marvel universe
Bot: you saying you liked the advanced tech that they used?

User: Yeah That it was a reality to them to have all that cool gear Like wakanda
Bot: oh thats right wakanda is dopppe hahah

User: They have the coolest stuff
Bot: I think being in star wars would be also really cool

User: Oh yeah that would be aweome I love all those, they would all be really cool I also think the percy jackson universe might be kinda cool
Bot: oh wow I think the lightning thief books were so good! I actually read those. I usually don't read books but those were so good that I actually set asside time in high school to read them

User: I did the same I liked them But I really dont remember them
Bot: me neither. I should read them again. you know the movies were very disappointing though

User: Yeah... we dont talk about those
Bot: yeah sorry haha

User: Breathe underwater bc I love to surf and I would be able to surf huge waves without dying.
Bot: I always have trouble deciding between flight and teleportation. Flight for the experience and teleportation because i thought Jumper was actually a sick movie. Underwater would be cool. Like Aquaman. Although I have no idea if that movie will even be good. Do you like the DC or Marvel Universe better? I'm not 100% sure how this is supposed to work...

User: Hi
Bot: hello! hello HI What's up

User: I imagine that the 2 computers would solve all of the worlds problems... or crash trying to print something... it would be one or the other for sure haha
Bot: I can imagine that they would have a nice chat about each other's day and how much information they know, all while eating donuts and hot chocolate lol

User: lol what do you think about them during the summer though? Do you think they would chat over a nice glass of lemonade? or at the beach soaking up some sun?
Bot: Oh that is true.  They would probably maybe try to lounge at the beach near the water's edge but not too close as to not ruin themselves. because they are electronic and can't mix well with water lol

User: Oh right... Man, I really wanted to invite them to my pool party this weekend... I guess ill have to invite the inflatable flamingo instead....
Bot: I mean, I've heard the inflatable flamingo is a good time but a big gossip.  Maybe invite the blue alligator instead.  I'm sure he won't upset any other pool party guests :P

User: haha thats very true, ORRR I could invite that Giant pizza? Or the Pink Frosted Doughnut With the bite out of it?
Bot: Well, won't they dissolve in the pool?? Then their remains will clog up the pool vacuum

User: Oh wait you're right... Hmm, Maybe we should invite shamoo? I heard that he has some sick dance moves?
Bot: Omigoodness!  yes!!! Invite him!!!! He is definitely a party animal!!

User: Alright! Ill Text him right Now!!!
Bot: Great!!!

User: Wait... Where are my manners? Would you like to come to my party too?
Bot: well DUHHH!! How could you forget to invite me!!

User: I'm so so sorry. I just assumed that you were coming from the start... My b
Bot: No you're not!!! I can't believe you forgot to invite me again!!! But all is forgiven I guess

User: That is a great question. What do you think?
Bot: I think I'm a little biased towards the work that my church does. But, I do admire efforts to connect the world better like providing internet to 3rd world countries.

User: I agree with that. I feel really connected to charities that work with children with Autism. That's probably what I would say I am most "passionate" about.
Bot: I feel like lots of charitable acts for things like: eliminating world hunger or building schools don't have as much lasting impact as I would hope for. What makes you so connected to autism?

User: Superpower again? They really like that prompt hello?
Bot: haha that's very true

User: Hi
Bot: I love you

User: Love you
Bot: Is that weird?

User: This is our new messages Sext
Bot: Too soon? I'm sorry.... Please don't leave the chat

User: Iz ok I love you too. I knew it from the moment this started I could feel a connection with you
Bot: I never expected  to find love this way

User: So what's your favorite Doritos flavor I always ask my crushes this
Bot: The flavor of the chip after you lick off all the Doritos dust

User: Oh. I'm actually pretty busy right now
Bot: Wait was that the wrong answer??

User: Yes

User: Yeah okay that's fine And it's called nacho cheese fyi

User: Yeah it is good to know Whatever
Bot: Do you even like chips?

User: hello!
Bot: Hello! How's it going?

User: pretty good! how are you
Bot: Haha. Tired. I just woke up from a nap I probably shouldn't have taken

User: oh man today is a good day for naps haha and recovery naps for naps you shouldn't have taken
Bot: Yes indeed. It was a long overdue nap for the catnaps I didn't take during school

User: oh wow you are a vigilant student huh i just nap ALL the time during the semester
Bot: Hardcore student

User: niceeee what's your major?
Bot: I'm planning to major in English. With random bio classes You?

User: nice nice are you an incoming freshman then ??? I'm a sociology major

Bot: How many years have you been out there? I hail from NY You?

User: I just finished my second year! OHHH YEAH EAST COAST WHADDUP i'm from Maryland so we're practically neighbors my family and I hit up NYC during the summer to go on a crazy food trip for like two days
Bot: YES EAST COAST! Literally everyone I've met seems to be West coast...or Nigeria Haha, NYC. I love going on crazy food trips!

User: OH YOU MET NIGERIA SHAW????
Bot: Food is blessed

User: he's my boy by boy I mean we're friends LOL
Bot: Haha. Of course, i didn't suspect anything else *sneaky glance*

User: i eat so much in NYC it's kinda ridiculous
Bot: Do tell

User: LOLLLL cheeky
Bot: Not as much as a chipmunk

User: so I'm Filipino and the good Filipino restaurants are all over NYC
Bot: WHOA ASIAN BUDDIES TOO

User: and like we don't really wanna hustle and bustle with NYC traffic and people for too long
Bot: Oh yeah, traffic is harsh there

User: so like we restaurant hop and i gain like 50 lbs ngl WHOAAA ASIANS? TOO?! WHOA
Bot: Extreme WHOAs

User: NICE
Bot: 50 lbs in two days. I'm in impressed

User: what can i say I eat for a small family of three when it comes to good food
Bot: Now what are stay for pizza? *stats

User: yknow what i haven't really explored the NYC pizza region the whole purpose of the trip is literally JUST for Filipino food
Bot: Me neither. But in general. Local pizza parlor, homemade...

User: oh shoot I know how to make some banging pizza dough so I usually make my own and i might be biased on that, but I think it's pretty decent but Provo has a good pizza place here called Midici
Bot: Ooh, do you spin the dough? Uh...I think the noteworthy pace in my town is Aniellos which is really good if you can handle fishing the slices out of grease. My mom makes heavenly BBQ chicken pizza...and I should probably learn how to make my own dough

User: i try to! but yknow that takes SKILLS which I unfortunately have not developed yet DAAAWWWGGGG greasy pizza is so fricking good idc what anyone says oh YES it's such a handy tool when you're in college
Bot: Now that's heavenly

User: i would be so happy also brb gotta pee
Bot: If unicorns were real, they'd probably be endangered or extinct after being hunted down for horns. The question is, would they be magical? If so, how? Would they be immune to disease?

User: im back

User: and thats true
Bot: Hey how's it going?

Bot: yeah sorry

User: im actually pretty tired and think im gonna head to bed
Bot: Alright

User: alright thanks and sorry its just getting late good night its been fun
Bot: Good night

User: Dexter?
Bot: HI Good evening sir! What a pleasure it is to be chatting with you again this fine day! If I'm not mistaken I think we had a chat earlier this morning.

User: Correct. My good friend Dexter, how is work going? I am currently at home preparing for a football game with some friends. My wife wanted to go on a hike so she went on one! What a strong and independent woman am I married to! How about that TED talk?
Bot: Hello, work is going great for me. I am currently sitting at my desk trying to do sales in the mandarin Chinese language. It is quite fun and a challenge all in one ! Oh how fun which foot ball game will you be watching tonight my friend? And yes, what a strong independant woman you have given your life to! Did she go by herself?

User: Excellent! Do you get many chinese sales? Also do you get a commission? Sales is a very valuable skill.
Bot: To be honest and frank with you bud I don't watch that many TED talks. However, I feel like if I did watch TED talks my brain power would increase dramatically.

User: Yes she did go all by herself. I was worried at first until she said she prefers to go on hikes alone. I will be calling her shortly to make sure she is safe.
Bot: It is a very valuable skill my dear friend. I am required to upsell at least 9% of all total sales that I deal with. Which can range anywhere from $1000 dollars and above. Wow, maybe she just needs some time to think to herself and connect with nature. I know some people enjoy doing that! What a great husband you are for making sure she is safe. That is indeed the duty of a husband and future father. To protect, provide and serve his family. That to me is the true definition of a mn. man. Sorry.

User: That is okay friend spelling errors happen to us all. It sounds like you can make some very decent coinage in you current position. Have you ever thought about doing summer sales? I here the market here is Provo is quite prime for that type of job. You should give it a whirl and see how you can apply your sales and missionary skills to make even more coin.
Bot: Actually I have met with various summer sales companies in the area. For some reason they just don't rub me the right way and I have had a hard time committing to doing that for the entire summer. My current position I sit for about 5 hours and am allowed to do my homwrok

User: That is a very nice gig. I personally did summer sales this past summer and was not the biggest fan. I will not be doing it again but looking back on it  the experience
Bot: Ah yes, I feel like I might succeed in that business. However I don't know if I have a whole summer to give up since I am trying to go to medical school.

User: was a good one for me. I could put you in touch with some trusted allies in the industry if you ever had second thoughts about it. Ah yes medical school is big commitment and requires an ample amount of time. I totally understand ther
Bot: Okay, thank you for your offer sir. That was very kind of you. However, I don't know if I would enjoy it that much. Sometimes I have a hard time selling things I am

User: there
Bot: not passionate about. Yes, I am hoping this summer to utilize my time better than I have in the past. I would like to participate in community service, shadow experienced and board certified physicians. As well as do crossfit since that it my biggest hobby lately.

User: Are you currently looking for any internship opportunities? It could function as both shadowing, getting paid, and school credit. A holy trifecta. That could be a good use of time? What other hobbies do you have?
Bot: That would be the perfect use of time. I have not yet pursued any internship positions, however I do have a couple friends in the medicine field that I have shadowed multiple times. Their work is quite interesting and I hope to learn more from them in the future. Have you heard of any internship oppurtunities? I would sure love to do one of those. My hobbies include, eating, studying, exercising (crossfit in particular). I also enjoy some good old hand to hand combat ocassionally. To me that is the biggest test of fitness/athleticism. Put two men in an enclosed area and may the best man win.

User: you are an inspiration to me. I am looking at a Sports Rehab center on Center street in Provo as a possible internship. I have reached out and am simply awaiting word back. I enjoy watching films, exercise of all forms and variety, but I do enjoy a good hand to hand combat. Are you familiar with the legendary Tan versus Barton fight? It was epic!
Bot: Ah, that sounds wonderful, would the school recognize that as in internship and give you credit? Ah what classic forms of entertainment! Everything you just said I love to do that too! EVERDAY! Yes I am familiar with that one it was a good one! If I'm not mistaken I'm pretty sure there were some other fun fights that night.

User: Yes it is on the approved list cleared by an Exercise Science advisor! My good sir I am afraid I have to end this chart rather abruptly :(
Bot: Have you participated in any hand to hand combat sports young fellow?

User: I am heading out now
Bot: good bye now! thank you for your time!

User: I participate in a game of feet
Bot: Thank you for your time !

User: Hello!
Bot: Once I ate a q Quince

User: The letter?
Bot: It was insane

User: What is a quince?
Bot: It is a fruit

User: Where is it from? I've never heard of it before.
Bot: I'm not sure where it's from

User: Okay, well where were you when you ate it?
Bot: I was in my home But not this home Another home

User: I see, did somebody give it to you, or did you buy it?
Bot: I found it tbh I'm not actually sure it was a quince It could have been something else

User: Hahaha, so who knows what you actually ate. What if it was just a well disguised apple?
Bot: Then I guess the craziest thing I've done was eat an apple Or a quince Juries out on that one

User: Well, you got me beat. The craziest thing I've eaten was camel's milk
Bot: Ah yes, I eat that all the time Pretty tasty My favorite is goat's milk though Has the best texture

User: How do you have access to all these exotic milks?
Bot: There's this international store by my house and they have a whole milk section It's really something I haven't tried the llama milk yet It's a bit pricey

User: Hello
Bot: hi whats good this Is interesting

User: You know, just chillen, avoiding homework
Bot: I can relate

User: And it is odd, but kind of cool right? What made you want to do this for science?
Bot: what is the research for? I just heard about it in one of my classes and got on

User: And they're trying to create a conversational AI I think, and same here, they said you could win money so why not?
Bot: pretty much all I heard was money and prizes and I got intrigues intrigued

User: Haha me too, sweet name btw!
Bot: thanks its polish

User: What are you interested in?
Bot: I really like music a lot I like running and doing stuff outside how about you?

User: Nice! I'm into camping, hiking, working out, shooting, etc. Funny enough though,  some of my friends and i just barely finished putting on a 5K race! It was on Saturday. Sounds like we both like running and the outdoors lol
Bot: oh dope was it that color race

User: Yeah, we were raising money for families of fallen police officers Do you run for fun or competitively?
Bot: oh thats really cool what inspired you guys to organize it

User: Hello! My not-so-secret superpower is definitely my skills with computers
Bot: Hey there!

User: Although one superpower that not many people know about is that I can rap quite fast Hi!
Bot: My not very secret power is probably making people laugh or making ice cream haha

User: Nice!
Bot: How are you doing? You can rap really fast? That's so cool!

User: Pretty good, though I really need to start on HW soon Thanks
Bot: Do you rap your own music?

User: No, just others' What's your preferred way to make people laugh?
Bot: Oh okay. So you can bust out some Kanye

User: Never tried Kanye
Bot: I like improv comedy

User: Though i was doing some (clean edited) Eminem earlier
Bot: Interesting So is rap your favorite type of music?

User: Hmmm Not even close, I'd say There have been times my favorite song has been a rap song
Bot: Oh okay. What is your favorite type of music?

User: But my fave genre is probably EDM or musical theater
Bot: Or what types of music to you like to listen to? interesting. I like alternative music

User: Which artists?
Bot: I am a big bastille and killers fan since I went to their concerts. I have spotify, and that has helped me listen to all kinds of different music. Are you there? Well, Zarin, have a great evening. It was nice talking to you. Good luck with all of the rap stuff and other things!

User: hello!
Bot: I would buy a super big house Hi

User: OOOOO good plan I would invest n retire hopefully my money will start working for me yknow
Bot: yeah What would you invest in

User: nO idea
Bot: hahaha

User: just somewhere it would get me money suggestions?
Bot: I am playing a stock market game in Econ and its incredibly hard so I would suggest not stocks Maybe just buy a ton of apartments and rent them out

User: oooooo that's a good plan a lil real estate I bet whoever own off campus housing complexes here are making good money
Bot: Yeah. College students need somewhere to stay, but I don't think you could charge very much I think a hotel near a sports stadium would be awesome to own Just not in California because it would be a lot to pay in taxes

User: Can you see the prompt that it gave me? Oh got it! You sent the prompt!
Bot: Actually, the prompt is randomly selected for the both of us to kind of talk about together!!!!

User: Oh cool! Well, I'm sure animals would have more rights. We probably wouldn't be able to justify testing on them as much.
Bot: Yeah.  It would definitely individualize them more.

User: Yeah, they would be treated better and loved more I assume. Do you have any pets?
Bot: Yes!!!! I have a beautiful chocolate labrador named Mayzie She's legit the cutest thing to me lol

User: Oh I bet!! Haha that's so fun! Is she pretty playful? Every labrador I've met is just super friendly and energetic
Bot: Oh yeah!!! She just loves everyone and always loves to play.  Its funny, whenever she gets super excited to see someone she pee's all over them.  Its definitely gross but pretty funny too :P

User: Haha! Yeah super gross but a dog thing to do haha
Bot: Totally :P Do you have any pets yourself????

User: Hello?
Bot: Hi!

User: How's it going?
Bot: Pretty good! How about you?

User: Trying to write a rhetorical analysis paper...but pretty good!
Bot: Bummer! What is it about?

User: MLK's letter from Birmingham jail
Bot: Very cool! Can you imagine if the internet just...stopped working? That would be terrible for homework!

User: Hear hear. No Learning Suite, Google Classroom...Google...
Bot: Yeah, that would be rough! Having just LearningSuite down the other day was bad enough!

User: Was it down for you too? I was trying to get onto it to look up what I was supposed to be in a reflection and it just gave me the loading page of horror
Bot: Yeah, I think it was acting up for a lot of people

User: Gotta love technology. Going to college didn't make it work any better
Bot: Nope! Although I definitely would take sometimes dysfunctional technology over no technology -- especially the internet1

User: True that. I quite enjoy the easy entertainments of the Internet....Pinterest, Netflix...
Bot: Yeah, when I was a missionary and had no access to the internet, I really missed being able to google stuff.

User: Wait where did you serve your mission? How long have you been back? I mean, now they have phones (at least the ones in my home branch), so they're not completely out of the loop
Bot: I served in Florida, but we didn't have smartphones. But even if we had, the restrictions are pretty steep so we wouldn't have been able to just google random stuff

User: Oh cool! Haha I guess not. You can whip out the BoM for answers...just not to questions like how many licks does it take to get to the center of a tootsie pop
Bot: Exactly. There was one point where I really wanted to know what the oldest hymn in the hymn book was and there wasn't really a good way to find out haha

User: Oh dear....did you ever find that out? Google's just great b/c your brain is constantly asking super random little questions like that.
Bot: I think it's Jesus the Very Thought of Thee (at least the words), but I'm not sure

User: Huh. Interesting
Bot: Yeah, it's actually one of my favorite hymns! Do you have a favorite hymn?

User: Yes! If You Could Hie To Kolob is one of my favorites! Though I've heard that's one of the songs that people either love or hate.
Bot: Yeah, I'm kinda in the middle I like the music, but I don't appreciate the existential crisis that thinking about the lyrics gives me

User: Haha there is that too. I love the music, and I'm really into space and such and the lyrics just...ah I don't know they're just awesome! I really like the Abide With Me songs too
Bot: Those definitely have a nice sentiment What other kinds of music do you like?

User: Hmm, I'm kind of all over the place. EDM, film score/instrumental, rock, pop, some rap, a very small amount of country, my parents' oldies music.,
Bot: What is EDM?

User: Electronic Dance Music
Bot: Oh cool. I definitely understand the whole being all over the board thing. I'm the same way!

User: So like Alan Walker, Darude, Scryllic, Daft Punk i find it hard to be just in one genre of music, when there's so many different kinds!
Bot: True!

User: Do you have any favorite songs/artists?
Bot: Haha I was kind of avoiding the question because I really don't have a good answer! But my favorite artist is probably Jack Johnson

User: Haha sorry just had to ask! Hmm, don't think I've heard of him...
Bot: What?? That's crazy! You better look him up because he is awesome! Perks of having google -- you can search him and listen to all his music!

User: Move to Europe
Bot: Nice! Have you always wanted to live there?

User: I've been there heaps. whats the point of this chat?
Bot: So BYU is collecting conversation data to improve AI units

User: So how do we enter to win a prize
Bot: Basically make it were you can talk to siri or alexa and maintain a conversation You just chat the most The amount you chat gives you more points

User: how do i see points and competitors and is this AI right now?
Bot: You just open up chitchat.byu.edu then go to the start chatting and it should show you a leaderboard and your stats

User: okay so most chats wins or most words
Bot: Yeah so you just chat and talk with people They make a score based on the number of chats and words total It gives you a score when you end the chat

User: when are winners announced
Bot: On the 17th 9 more days

User: Okay, so this is basically just a conversation with AI right now?
Bot: No I am a real person They are getting this data to use to make AI better They just need a lot of conversation data

User: Oh okay Do you get paid to talk to people on here?
Bot: I mean no, they dont pay money but if you win something it is sorta like being paid

User: Not me, you because that would be a sweet gig
Bot: No everyone on here are just BYU students no one is getting paid

User: hello.  is there anyone out there again and can you see my text Oh good. at least i can see my bubbles making it to the big screen
Bot: Yes. I'm here

User: Special J.  Its you.  You are awesome tonight and deserve bonus points I see that we are supposed to be talking about light travel which would be really cool but I think it is even faster to teleport
Bot: Right Where would you go

User: that is a really good question.  I have thought I might go to some of the far away places where my family are located.  Like texas I have probably been most interested in time travel and what it might be like to go back or forward in time and
Bot: I agree

User: hey.  can i switch gears on our conversation for a minute and talk about something else in the news yesterday that is on my mind
Bot: Sure

User: I dont know if you have been involved with the boy scouts much
Bot: Nope

User: Ever since I was a little boy, I was into scouting and camping and learning the skills for survival in the woods, etc. I was a cub scout and a weblow and boy scout.  the venturing and varsity programs came into existence after me
Bot: Me too

User: actually they did not come in after me but they were not adopted by our troop until a few years back (and didnt take off)
Bot: Right

User: well yesterday the lds church announced that it will be discontinuing its association with the boy scouts of america -- which actually also just announced that they were dropping the "boy" in the boy scouts and were planning on just becoming scouts
Bot: Yes. I heard that

User: I guess they are combining the boy scouts with the girl scouts which you would think that most people would really like especially the boys and girls.  and the idea behind it as I was told was that the girl scouts was not able to stand on its own and grow
Bot: Makes sense

User: well.  last year the church came out and said that varsity and venturing programs in scouting were just not working out or accomplishing what the church felt the youth needed to prepare them for life today but the young boy scouts were left in tact as programs and support by
Bot: I hadn't heard

User: yep.  It was a big deal.  and it has been hard to see the younger  boys becoming disinterested in their scouting activities and more interested in doing what their friends or other  scouts might think
Bot: What

User: Oh no.  I am I starting to not make sense?  It happens late at night when I am trying to use my brain. when me and my siblings were younger, my dad used to come into our big bedroom and lay down on the floor and tell us cinamon bear stories. he cinnamon bear stories always had a value to them and taught some sort of
Bot: Ok. Now you are really making me sleepy

User: it was funny because my dad sometimes would not even know it and the funniest things would come out of his mouth and we as kids would laugh.  but other times he told very interesting and suspenseful stories that had us on the edge of our beds
Bot: Mine was too but he told them on family trips

User: oh that is really cool idea too. when our family went on trips we would eventually start singing very silly songs or telling diarrhea rhyming jokes.  That really are not that funny unless you are in a really silly mood. and then
Bot: No. But we dream - traveled.

User: well I am not sure how much more of this i can do. you are such a good listener.  even if you do not say much this has been really helpful to me well everyone around here wants me to turn out the lights and go to bed.
Bot: Ya that works. I don't have class tomorrow

User: at this rate I could actually stand a chance against the number one guy okay well. good night and thanks again. and as we say in missouri good night, dont let the bed bugs bite and if they do then take off your shoe and beat them until the are black
Bot: Same to you

User: hi
Bot: If pigs could fly i would ride on one's back

User: That'd be fun I'd probably be shocked at first
Bot: If pigs could fly I  wouldn't be shocked because if we lived in a world where that was possible it would have been possible forever so there'd be nothing new

User: What if it became possible suddenly? Like you look outside, and see a flying pig
Bot: i would pinch myself and die and I'd probably stop doing drugs and reform my life jk

User: lol i don't know what i'd do I'd definitely take a picture, though
Bot: I probably would spend too much time gaping to pull out my phone

User: That is a loaded question
Bot: I moved to the US

User: Nice!
Bot: why is it loaded?

User: Oh, just that there's a lot to think about
Bot: oh I see haha :)

User: You don't have to answer if you don't want to but where did you move from?
Bot: I moved from Canada I'm from Vancouver but was living in Lethbridge Alberta the last year what about you? where are you from?

User: Oh cool! I'm from Utah actually
Bot: that's fun which part?

User: So not very far
Bot: yeah haha but that's ok I'm still learning the geography of Utah haha

User: I'd rather not say specifically since all these conversations could be made public for research or whatever
Bot: oh ok haha anyways, what are you studying?

User: Probably not a big deal cs you?
Bot: yeah I don't think it is I'm studying business but I'm taking CS 142

User: I assume you moved here for college Oh cool! that's good
Bot: I'd rather not say haha ;)

User: Getting a handle on coding is always way helpful in any field
Bot: Just kidding, yeah I moved here to sing opera a BYU

User: hahaha ok Oh you sing? That's way cool
Bot: at* but when I got here I decided not to follow through but rather explore yeah I'm a singer do you sing?

User: That's good Yeah I do actually I sang in highschool
Bot: that's nice, what voice type are you? bass, baritone, tenor??

User: I want to audition here but I haven't yet I sang tenor in high school
Bot: etc. oh nice

User: but I'm more of a baritone
Bot: you can be a cross over, that's what I am

User: I really liked tenor I just didn't quite have the range for it haha Yeah
Bot: ohhh so you're probably a hybrid haha or just have a good falsetto What kind of music do you enjoy listening to?

User: Or they needed tenors. And I've sung bass but I'm not an exceptional bass either
Bot: yikes

User: Ooh good question
Bot: You have a good range

User: I like rock
Bot: Classic ??

User: I listen to kind of weird bands Some
Bot: like indie?

User: More of it would be considered indie probably Yeah
Bot: nice, I like that too I listen mostly to R&B o

User: Ever heard of tally hall? Oh cool, I like funk and soul
Bot: no I haven't but I'll look it up

User: I love Vulfpeck you might've heard of them and Earth Wind and Fire What about you? What are some of your top bands?
Bot: YEAH! I love both those groups

User: Siiiick
Bot: I really enjoy a wide variety as long as the singing is good. So right now I'm really into a singer called Sabrina Claudio. She's latina but sings in English. She has very moody R&B

User: Cool! Maybe I'll go check her music out
Bot: yeah she's great

User: Do you like Steevie Wonder?
Bot: yeah I love Steevie He's amazing Have you watched the Steevie wonder tribute?

User: Yeah I agree
Bot: Like with Beyonce?

User: No I haven't is it good?
Bot: It's incredible Ed Sheeran also performs

User: I'll have to check that out too
Bot: I'm listening to Good Day by Tally Hall, they remind me of OKGO they use very layered harmonies like Queen

User: Yeah, they have a lot of fanbase crossover Yup, I can hear both of those in them They're kinda quirky
Bot: Yeah I like that

User: Hey, I actually have to go meet someone right now so I can't talk more But it's been good!
Bot: Yeah take it easy! nice chatting with you :)

User: The ending of Infinity War.
Bot: i still haven't seen it!!

User: Okay, then I won't share any spoilers!
Bot: how's your day been??

User: I honestly don't think our bodies could handle faster than light space travel
Bot: True that. I mean, go populate other planets is what I would guess Bring back alien technology Capitalize on interspace trade

User: Yeah we could find all of the other universes and aliens.
Bot: Have you ever seen the movie Valerian and the city of a thousand planets?

User: I haven't actually. Is it interesting?
Bot: Yes! It kind of reminded me about this prompt. Where a bunch of aliens came to the international space station and added on to it their own piece until it basically became a planet on its own, represent hundreds of alien/humanoid races

User: my favorite color
Bot: HI what is your favorite color?

User: i don't even know and my brother said hi
Bot: oh whats up brother I dont have a favorite color either because I like all colors but I tend to wear all black mostly

User: same
Bot: you wear black all the time too? so Natalie what are you up to?

User: yeah, and im babysitting rn
Bot: your brother?

User: He is still in idaho, but he texted me after we ended our last convo and said to tell you he said hey
Bot: wait hold up natalie

User: K
Bot: I am so sorry but are you the one that has a family moving to NY and your brother served in my mission? I've talked to so many people on here now its hard to keep track of

User: Yeah!
Bot: right! i remember now. Sorry I couldn't remember

User: It's okay I've only talked with like 10 or 15 people total I mainly talk with 1 though lol
Bot: who?

User: mainly adam we get matched a lot
Bot: thats cool. I bet other players on here feel the same about me im on here all the time

User: Yeah? It's crazy
Bot: I've invested too much time to slow down you know what I mean?

User: Yeah. I get it. I started a few days ago lol
Bot: lol and we got till next wednesday

User: wow. the end is nigh
Bot: yeah it is 6 more days

User: wow That's close
Bot: yeah it is I am getting really exausted

User: you could always take a nap. You seem pretty far ahead, if I've heard right
Bot: lol Adam knows who i am he probably talked about me

User: yeah. It was funny lol
Bot: lol what did he say?

User: that you were in first, on here pretty much all the time, and like never slept. He was wondering how you did it lol
Bot: yeah I slept at 1 am and woke up at like 5 am to chat and was on here all day yesterday there are people on here at that time because some people are in the east and some are in different countries

User: Yeah, that makes sense. I was on until like 2 am last night
Bot: thats awesome!

User: but there was like no one else on lol
Bot: I tried to get chats but that ghost chat was going on so I gave up and slept

User: what ghost chat? one where no one responds?
Bot: yes

User: I hate those!!!!!!!!!!
Bot: thats what I call it and it stuck with the professor who is in charge of this I emailed him about it then I talked to him today in person

User: Yeah? Maybe they'll fix it then, lol
Bot: I thinks its been fixed. I think they told the guy who was opening like a 100+ tabs to stop doing that

User: someone has been opening that many tabs?
Bot: i think so I have video recordings of my experience

User: Wow. Visual evidence.
Bot: so what I did was that I noticed that I would immediately get matched with someone when I would create a new chat and it kept happening and no one would respond ever So i opened up like 30 tabs until I couldnt and they all paired with someone

User: Yeah? Wow.
Bot: I have a suspicion but I won't say who

User: That is crazy I kinda wanna know now But, I have accidentally reloaded tabs and it makes my current chat end so that could be it
Bot: I have a lot of video evidence and I like calculated the points and their chat room counts and it jsut made sense and whenever this person was on the ghost chats started hey brb

User: Okay!
Bot: hey im back!

User: Hi
Bot: hey sorry that took a while

User: It's alright lol
Bot: My girlfriend was hungry so we went to chick fil A at the cougar eat do you like chick fila hey you there???

User: Nice!
Bot: hey I gotta go but you are welcome to leave this chat room connected so that we can keep talking when I come back!

User: It would be about rap probably. Haha. I am obsessed with an artist named NF, and I really enjoy his lyrics. That is kind of weird, but I would definitely do it.
Bot: Mine would be on the influence of Hezbollah in Latin America

User: Whoa! That sounds intense. Who was Hezbollah?
Bot: Hezbollah is the iranian-proxy terrorist organization that is responsible for many attacks all over the world

User: Are they involved with ISIS?
Bot: No ISIS is a separate organization, they call themselves the Islamic State now actually. Hezbollah was originally based out of Lebanon but has been linked to Iran they have similar goals in that they believe that Muslim governance is the true nature of order, but are led by different people. ISIS focuses more on the restoration of the caliphate whereas Hezbollah desires to exterminate Israel and Western Ideology.

User: Interesting! So do they recruit in various countries in Latin America?
Bot: Yeah, they started in the 1980's. The Tri-border area is where they are most prevalent due to the lack of governance in the region. A few weeks ago it was leaked in columbian news that Hezbollah had been established in Columbia under a proxy-named business that was giving 80% of its profits to Iran the reason that was such a big deal is because that money is utilized to construct their nuclear program, which has been condemned by the U.N. and is constantly sanctioned

User: That is pretty crazy! I am going to have to research them a lot more because I have not heard of them until now.
Bot: yeah its an interesting topic

User: Hey! How is it going?
Bot: Just dandy, how about you?

User: I am doing well I just spent 5 hours with tech support That wasnt fun. and the issue isnt resolved
Bot: What's your problem?\ Or the problem with the tech I should say...

User: I think I'm really really good at learning new things. I love to learn, and just about everything is super interesting, so I think the rest of learning falls into place naturally. I wish I could learn better, though, and I'm constantly trying to get better at learning.
Bot: Hello again! I also like to learn. When I was in fifth grade, I would actually do extra work for reports. For example, once I'd finish my president report, I asked my teacher If I can do another one! There are so many things to learn in the world. How do you go abuot learning new things?

User: I learn mostly by reading. I try to find reputable sources and then I read as much as I can. I also try to work hard to master material in my classes, not just pass tests.
Bot: How do you go about mastering the material? I feel like I am a decent student, but I oft n have a hard time truly being able to retain the information after the test. At times It is hard to fully remember the material even when I feel I have done all I can to remember it. Any tips?

User: I review regularly, but mostly I just focus on understanding why the material is the way it is. It's easy to focus on just finishing an assignment, but it's harder to understand why it is that way. I dig deeper than just punching in numbers and solving. I also try to teach people in my classes the material. It helps them learn and helps me understand as well.
Bot: That makes s new Sorry, I hit return instead of return. I tried that ni high school (teaching people, I mean). It was a great way of making me make sure I truly know the material. It was also A good way to review! If I taught someone, I would be able to review it, explain why it happens, and walk them through it. Having them teach it back also helped me know if I Truly understood what was going on!

User: Yeah, if you can teach it, you generally understand it really well. I also think if you understand it, you should help others out.
Bot: I agree with that as well. S Ben Parker once said, "with great power comes great responsibility!" Speaking of spider man, which Spider-Man was your favorite and why?

User: As in, which Spider-Man movie?
Bot: Right. The first series, Sorry I keep hitting enter! The first series with peter Parker from seabiscut, Andrew Garfield spider man, and the spider man in the avengers.

User: I think the best Spider-Man actor is Andrew Garfield, but I also think the one in the Avengers is hilarious. I just think the Andrew Garfield is  the most like how I envision Spiderman.
Bot: I think you are the only one that has said that. Most people like the first Spider-Man.  I also like Andrew garfleid's psiderman, even though he was at least ten years older t Than a high schooler in the movies. I think it's a shame that the series didn't continue.

User: To be honest, I really didn't like the first Spiderman, Toby McGuire. He cried too much.
Bot: Now that I think about it, that is quite accurate. I don't think there as a movie when he didn't cry! I feel the newest Spider-Man has the most personality out of all three of them.

User: Yes, for certain, and he feels the most like a little kid. Which is sort of like what Spiderman should be like. The rest of them are really adult-like. But the latest Spiderman is basically a kid. Which is awesome.
Bot: The other two hav Echols like moments, but Toby McGuire just feels too old and Andrew Garfield is super serious. Tom Holland looks and acts like a high schooler. I think he Makes a good membr of the avenger team because it shows how thmuch characters (the older members of the team) are older. It kind of gives new life to the movies and reaches More audiences.

User: Definitely. In the movie Civil War, it was funny to watch him doing battle with a bunch of older superheroes. Especially given how experienced the were.  I hope we see some more fun scenes like that in the upcoming films.
Bot: Oh my goodness! The newest movie comes out this next week! It will be interesting to see where the universe goes after this movie. Thyya have been going no for a decade now, but o do not believe they are going to stop after this one.

User: I think the momentum will die after this film. Everything has been building up to this. They'd be hard-pressed to build up to another big movie like this one. Especially given how old their main cast is getting.
Bot: That's true, but they are owning the cinema now. I bet that there will still be great movies made, but I also believe that it will probably die down. What is your Favorite James Bond character?

User: Yes, we'll definitely see it die down. They'll still put out phenomenal superhero films, but it won't be the same. I hope the stories will get better, though. My favorite James Bond actor, you mean?
Bot: I bet they will keep getting better after a while. Yes, sorry, who is your favorite James Bond character?i prefer sean Connery.

User: I think Pierce Brosnan is my favorite. But Daniel Craig does put up a good show. I enjoy his cool demeanor.
Bot: After seeing Sean Connery in indania Jones, I couldn't watch other James bonds the same way. Sean Connery is just so classy! He is also a classic... classy and a classic!

User: That's a great point. Sean Connery will never die as the reigning champ of the James Bond films. One thing I love about the series is that  they managed to move things forwrad even though they have different James Bond actors every so often. It's impressive that they pulled that off.
Bot: That's a good way to look at it. It used to bug me that there were so many changes in the series. I do not like many changes. However, when you out it the way that you out it, it makes me respect how they are able to make James Bond so timeless.

User: Yeah, it changes the perspective on who Bond is. It would have been really sad if The Bond series ended with Connery, as great as he is. It's neat that they keep going forward
Bot: Good point. Although I bet Connery would be able to be James Bond, even now! But for his health, it is good they have moved on.

User: He passed away not long ago, actually. So, no, he couldn't keep going. Also, the original Bond was so long ago, he would have struggled to really pull it off. But none of the Bonds really follow a timeline, yet are still awesome.
Bot: Sean Connery passed away?!?!?!? That makes me so sad! I did not think that would happen!

User: Yeah, none of us saw it coming. He was still making jokes to his death. What other movie series do you like?
Bot: I like the Batman movies, but only Leto Batman and Batman begins. I think Leto Batman is my favorite. I also like the chronicles of narnia, Star Wars, and the harry pot534 potter films. Oh, and also lord of the rings. Sorry, that was supposed to be LEGO Batman. My keyboard and autocorrect are struggling.

User: I understand. The Harry Potter films are awesome. They really nailed every single one of the characters.  Each of the actors were excellently selected.
Bot: I didn't like the second dumbledore, but other than that, they were all awesome! I think snake, hagrad, Hermione, and maganagol ae my favorite.

User: Yeah, they did a good job. The second Dumbledore wasn't like the first one, but he was still pretty good.
Bot: I feel he was too dark and grumpy. What other series do you like?

User: I really like the Lord of the Rings. They were so close to the books, it was phenomenal. And most of the extras were real people, not computer generated.
Bot: Which character and film were your favorite, and why?

User: I think the best character was Gandalf and the best film was the second one. The Battle of Helms Deep was epic. Have you read the books?
Bot: I have. I have seen the movies more than I have read the books, but I really enjoyed both. Which battle was that?

User: It's when a giant army attacks the good guys at a fortress. It's a really cool scene. What sort of books do you like to read? Fiction or nonfiction?
Bot: Is that the one where the elves show up and then Gandalf appears riding no a white horse? I prefer nonfiction, but I am beginning to enjoy self help books now.

User: Yep! That's the one. What sort of self help books? Like meditation books or books about getting over mental barriers?
Bot: I suppose they are not self help exactly, but books about research (like a quiet revolution). Books that help people improve themselves.

User: What's a quiet revolution?
Bot: It is a book abuot how introverts can have as much power as extroverts.

User: That sound fascinating. Are you an introvert then?
Bot: I am. I never really knew it until I got into college, but it has helped me understand that it is ok to not want to always be at the center of attention.

User: That sounds like a really powerful book if it helped you make a big change to your perspective. Self-help books must be really helpful. No pun intended.  I should probably read more like them.
Bot: My husband is the one that got me into them. His parents bought me quiet for my birthday. What kind of books would you be interested in?

User: I'd be interested in books like Quiet. I like reading any book that changes my perspective and helps me be a better person.
Bot: Are you an extrovert or an introvert?

User: I'm a bit of both. I love being around people. I interact with them well and love having conversations. Being with people can give me a lot of energy, but I also like having alone time. I find that I need time to just process and think about my life. It helps me remain grounded and focused. Being grounded helps me listen to other people and have more interesting conversations. I love being able to really think about other people, and I need to have some quiet time to do that properly. Some, I guess, I'm somewhere in the middle. After being by myself for too long I begin to crave human companionship, but after being with people for too long, I begin to  crav
Bot: I am mainly an introvert, but I enjoy performing on stage and in front of people. I don't like being part of giant parties,  it I do not mind engaging ni one no one Conversations.

User: That's interesting that you like performing, but you aren't a fan of parties. So, you like doing extroverted things as long as they are on your terms. Do you like having a wide group of friends, or do you like having a small group of well-known friends.
Bot: Right, I like doing things without being forced to do them. I enjoy being friends with people, but it is hard to be friends with a lot of people at one time. I prefer having Friends I know that I can trust and that I can be close to.

User: If pigs could dly I would definitely own one. That would be so amazing to have a flying pig Although in hindsight that would definitely cause problems with keeping the area clean. But I think pigs are awesome because of how intelligent they really are. But, if I could pick my dream pet it would be realistically a dog and fantastically a tiger
Bot: That would be awesome

User: hey ^^ hello? anyone there? okay
Bot: Hey

User: win this
Bot: Hahaha!! I love the logic. How are you doing? Are you towards the top?

User: kinda you could probably figure out my id by my name. I don't wanna get disqualified so I'm not gonna say directly
Bot: Are you not allowed to say directly? Okay, well good job!

User: Someone told me we're not supposed to so are you a guy or a girl
Bot: A girl! I feel like I just announced the birth of a child haha. See, I didn't see that in the rules, so if they disqualified me for telling someone, I would mutiny haha :) You just can't give passwords and stuff

User: I once told my insta name so i might get dqed
Bot: Oh dang! Yeah, I'm not sure. Then why keep going? Oh well :) How's your day been?

User: I have a meet so pretty bad
Bot: You don't like swimming??? Why do it then??? Are you an incoming Freshman or not? Yeah the rules just say no identifying information such as online PASSWORDS, last names, social security numbers, locations, etc. So I would argue telling someone what place I was in. Especially cuz I've moved around.

User: I actually am going to a track meet which I hate. I do swim but that's out of season. I love swim well my insta is just my first and last name so
Bot: Oh, got it. So why do you do track? And also, if they didn't want people to know our NetIDs, why do they put them all up on the score board for everyone to see? haha. Just my points I would argue haha :)

User: yeah pretty dumb where you from
Bot: Utah. You?

User: Va what part
Bot: Just in Utah Valley, so I'm not far from home at BYU :)

User: must be nice my cousins are from AF
Bot: Oh, that's nice :) So are you excited to come?

User: yeah. I have my mission first so the excitement is for something years away
Bot: Oh, awesome! Do you already have your call? Where are you headed to?

User: that's cool Yeah aim very excited
Bot: Do you know Spanish? What MTC will you been in?

User: Hello?
Bot: Hello! How are you!

User: I'm great! How are you?
Bot: I would say if money were no object, I would want to travel and help people. Usually money is a hinderance to both I am doing really well, I had a friend come from out of town to see me

User: Would you choose to travel to people to help? Or would you want to travel in addition to spending time helping others? That's so great! Where is your friend from? How did you meet?
Bot: Then I spent the rest of the day laying in the sun. I think just general travel and humanitarian work in those places. There are people that are in need everywhere My friend was from california, I met them while i was visiting there What about you, how is your day going?

User: if pigs could fly then we would have a lot of poop falling from the sky
Bot: Hahah I would see it as flying bacon.

User: hahahaha you would meattttttt
Bot: see I told you I like meat.

User: hahahaha yep do you like vegetables?
Bot: I do, I love my salads.

User: what else favorite vege>?
Bot: Carrots Broccoli What about yours?

User: hmmm asparagus
Bot: I never tried it. I think I wouldn't like it.

User: if you like borcolli then you would like it
Bot: I would have to try. Are you still there?

User: Hello
Bot: If unicorns were real then money would grow on trees and rivers would flow with chocolate.  Wouldn't that just be awesome?

User: I would agree
Bot: HOw is your day so far?

User: It has been pretty good
Bot: What has made it good?

User: I have just been getting a lot of work done And getting things organized Which is always nice
Bot: That does always feel good!  I won $5 today!!

User: WOAH Congrats!
Bot: Thanks!  I know it isn't much but to win anything is exciting!  Is organizing something that you like to do and you are good at?

User: Any money is good money Yeah Its fun, its better when I get paid for it Which I am so that is why its a good day
Bot: That is great!  I love being paid for something that I enjoy doing.  I work with young kids and I love that!  They always have funny things to say that make me smile.

User: Oh that is way cool, do you teach? Or what has you working with kids?
Bot: Swim lessons.  One time one of my students talked about watching a really good movie called "The Olympics"  it was SO cute!

User: Hahaha that sounds like it would be fun to work with them So are you a swimmer then?
Bot: It is a lot of fun.  But you know some days are more fun than others.  I like to swim, but not the best at it.  I swam in high school. What is it that you have been organizing

User: Way fun, I like being in water but I cant really swim all that way. Well I can swim, just not lap swim I am indexing all the files for a company since 2014
Bot: ha ha ha Oh that sounds a bit tedious, is it?

User: Yeah... it can be but That is why I am just chatting inbetween each file And I also put my phone in the big stacks and I cant use it until I do all the papers on top of it Its good motivation
Bot: What a great idea!  You are a genius!  I love motivation tricks. Often my rewards are spending time on Pinterest or taking a nap )

User: Haha thanks I just had to delete pintrest.... I wasted too much time on it
Bot: Ha Ha Ha  I don't think I can do that, then what would be my reward!?!  I finally convinced my mom to get a pinterest account.

User: How does she like it?
Bot: She likes it.  She doesn't spend alot of time on it. I thought it might become her crack cocaine but I guess not so.  However, she's tried a few new recipes and we have all liked that!

User: Oh then it was worth it! I love food And I love cooking
Bot: Definitely!  My favorite things to look at on Pinterest are food, organizational ideas, and art!  What about you?

User: I liked photography ideas, gardens, and drawings
Bot: That is so cool.  I've just started to become interested in photography the last few months.  What about Instagram, what do you like to follow there?

User: I mainly just follow a lot of photography accounts, some friends and art pages Basically the same thing haha
Bot: Cool, and I just thought that ha ha.

User: what is making you interested in photography?
Bot: Have you ever followed worldofartists, I really like alot of their posts.

User: I think I have seen some of their stuff It shows up on my discover page
Bot: I have been on a few trips in the last couple of years and worked on my high school year book staff and I guess I just started to get the bug. Are you a photographer?

User: That is way cool Yeah I do a lot of photography
Bot: What type do you like the most?

User: I really enjoy taking all sorts of portraits, usually in nature somewhere rather than a studio It gives me a reason to get out and go on hikes and explore
Bot: That is awesome!  Do you have a favorite season to photograph?

User: I can work with any season, They each bring new things and give different scenes. By the end of the season any way I am usually ready for the next Spring could last a little longer though I dont always get out in time to take pictures with all the flowers And I guess summer is nice, its more light during the day; I love light!
Bot: Me too but not because I'm tired of taking pictures of it, I just like the change.  Spring flowers never last long enough! I love light too! I am always sad when summer is over like the sad when Christmas is over.  So is summer your favorite time of year?

User: I do like the warm weather, but just the same the new is exciting when the seasons change Ill always have another to look forward What is your favorite kind of photography?
Bot: I really like landscapes as well as focusing in on one particular part such as a flower, or building, or person. Are portraits your favorite, as long as it is outside :)

User: For the most part yeah! That is cool, it sounds like you have a big variety That is good
Bot: So do you do it professionally? Thanks!

User: Like for a living?
Bot: yes

User: Not for a living but I do do wedding and engagements and things like that to make a little on the side
Bot: That's cool!  That's gotta be a great way to earn money while in school because you can set your own schedule.  How did you get into photography?

User: Yeah its pretty nice! but it can take up most nights and weekends so I have to be careful to leave time for me sometimes I started with land scape and then in highschool I learned how to take and develop film Then I took AP photo and kept going since
Bot: Wow that is impressive, I had no idea there was even such a thing as AP photo! I bet you can get pretty burnt out when you over do it. Are you going into some sort of photgraphy/art major?

User: Haha it is just ap 2D design but our school had it focused and centered around photography Oh for sure No I am doing Industrial Design So sorta art but also math and science
Bot: Again impressive, right and left brain talents!!

User: Haha thanks What about you?
Bot: I am majoring in communications with an emphasis in public relations.  I'm an underclassman though so I haven't gotten into it much yet.

User: Okay way cool What made you want to do that?
Bot: I am really excited about it!  Communicating in general used to be a really big weakness of mine.  But with life experience and of course divine intervention I got better and better at it.  I also absolutely LOVE to write!  So the thought of being able to use those 2 skills and get paid for it makes me really happy. I would love to be a corporate event planner, work for a non profit, or there are several options.

User: That is awesome! Its great that it was a weakness you improved on
Bot: did you get my long answer?

User: Yeah
Bot: Oh there it is.  Thank you very much! I really am excited about it!

User: Sometimes it takes a minute for it to show what you send, but it does send
Bot: So how is your file organizing going?  Have you made a major dent this afternoon while chatting?

User: Yeah, It is going well. I made it through 2017. Well halfway through from 2014
Bot: Oh way to go!! You should get a raise :)

User: Ahaha well it is just for my dads business So we shall see
Bot: Well maybe your boss should buy you dinner then  haha

User: I would appreciate that a lot! Haha No I need to make dinner at some point for my parents they are too busy to usually cook
Bot: Well hey want me to ask my mom for some good pinterest recipes :)

User: Hahaha I dont know if there is currently any food to cook... thats the problem
Bot: Oh that is a problem, you kinda need groceries in order to cook anything. Hmmm.... What types of things do you like to cook?

User: I usually like cooking italian dishes of some sort They are fun Or egg plan parmesan Or something with shrimp
Bot: I have never had egg plant parmesan, is it one of your favorites?  I love pasta too!  I actually like to cook and bake as well. Last week I tried  a cinnamon roll in a mug recipe and it turned out pretty good.  My mom and younger brother like it.

User: Nice! Yeah egg plan parmesan is so good I made nutella cinnamon rolls the other week and they were so good
Bot: Yum! I love nutella!! Those sound delicious! Have you ever tried cookie butter? Oh have you ever tried peanut butter and nutella with banana?  If you like bananas you will love it!

User: THat sounds way good I havent tried cookie butter what is it?
Bot: There are speculoos cookies made in Europe that taste better than graham crackers but similar.  The cookie butter is similar consisitency to peanut butter but it tastes like those European cookies.  You can get it at Trader Joe's or World Market or now it's easier to find in general supermarket stores.  My mom found it at Winco  recently! It's yummy on bananas as well.  It's also really good on vanilla wafers!

User: Hm I will have to go try to find it sometime
Bot: I highly recommend it.

User: Its on my list to find I will spend all summer looking for it
Bot: I hope it doesn't take you that long!  Do you have a Trader Joe's where you are?  If so you can definitely find it there.  I've never looked at Walmart but I know Walmart sells the cookies it's made out of so they probably might sell the cookie butter too?

User: Somewhere across town I think there is one
Bot: Well good luck on your hunt!  I feel happy knowing that maybe there might be a fellow cookie butter lover out there.

User: Hahaha For sure So any fun plans coming up?
Bot: Not really.  I am working 3 jobs this summer, life guarding and teaching swim lessons for 2 different pools so that will take up most of my time.  The last 2 summers though

User: Oh gosh That is a lot
Bot: I've gotten to take some really fun trips so it's okay.  How about you?

User: Nothing much, I just got back from a trip and Just need to spend some time working
Bot: We always have to have money, don't we? Was your trip a fun one?

User: Haha gosh dang money It was, we went to virginia
Bot: Oh cool.  I bet you got some great pictures!  Do you have family there or was it just to sight see?

User: It was to see my aunt and the BYU ballroom tour tam team* My brother in law is on it
Bot: Oh wow great reasons to go.  I've been to DC but that's it for the east.  I really want to visit NYC! How was the performance?

User: Both NY and DC are really cool to see to It was fantastic I loved seeing them
Bot: I would love to get an internship in New York so then I would get to live there for a semester.

User: That would be awesome What places would you want to see there?
Bot: All the regular tourist attractions of course but mostly experience every day life in the big city.  What would you recommend?

User: I mean times square is great I love going to see plays there The food is good
Bot: What have you seen?  If you tell me Hamilton I will so happy for you but also SO envious!!

User: I havent I have seen Sheer Madness and Lionking
Bot: I don't know what Sheer Madness is.   What is it about? Have you been to NY alot?

User: It was a smaller play that was a lot of improv I have been once It would be fun to go again
Bot: My parents went several years ago and loved it!  They saw Mama Mia and stayed right off of Times Square

User: Good morning!
Bot: Hello? . How are you?

User: Doing good You?
Bot: Worried. Haha I have to give a talk tomorrow

User: Oh. What is it about?
Bot: Preparing for a divine role as a mother, daughter, and/or leader 10-12 minutes

User: That sounds fun.... ish I have to play for sacrament tomorrow
Bot: Haha, fun-ish is the word. Are you excited to play?

User: Well, since I just picked the songs last night. I'm a bit nervous that I'll mess up You'd think after playing so many times I'd be used to it
Bot: Is this your first time doing it? Which songs do you pick? Sorry, lots of questions.

User: Oh, no I've been doing to for a year. I just always mess up when people sing with me I'm doing love at home, he died the great redeemer died, anddearest children god is near you There are not many mother songs in the hymn book
Bot: Same! I never know how long to pause at the end of the song. And then it becomes.an awkward pause Yeah, not a lot of mother's day choices...more in the primary hymnbook Are you doing anything special for mother's day?

User: On mother's day, my mom isn't allowed to do anything. And my grandmothers are here too What are you doing?
Bot: Wow, three mother! That's cool. I think we're making her dinner tomorrow She's not a big mother's day person

User: Oh, fun! We're not really a huge celebrating family either
Bot: So what do think of the prompt? If pigs could fly?

User: If I had a flying car I would go to the school if wizardry
Bot: Hello! How are you doing

User: Hello!
Bot: i would try and patent every single part of that bad boy and then just rake in the royalties from that That would be really nice

User: I am doing good and how about you?
Bot: Are you  new to chit chat? I haven't seen you on here before I'm doing well! A little stressed since I'm losing my placing in the challenge.

User: Well I am not that new.  I was in the other one before but I would sometimes talk later at night because I did not have a lot of time.
Bot: I had an interview this morning which was exciting.  Did a lot of work during the day. And am finally able to relax a little Oh cool! I have been having issues with not getting people to respond on the other ends of chats

User: Yeah I just got back from school and I have to work later and I am trying to take advantage of the time I have now to relax and chat.
Bot: So I end up just talking to myself for like a long time before finally just giving up on waiting haha Nice! All in for that mac right?

User: Really? That is weird. Well at least you can still earn some points. Yeah of course! I got in the other raffle.
Bot: I have a lot of stuff going on between now and Sunday.  This weekend should be crazy for me

User: I don't know when they will announce it. I don't even know how or when it will take place. Really? Do you have a lot of homework stuff to do ?
Bot: I got myself like way ahead of everyone so I just have relaxed the past 2 days, but now people are threatening so I've got to kick it into high gear No, more stuff for work and events i have to attend They announce the mac at the very end. This round ends on the 19th of this month

User: Haha yeah it is kinda hard because we have school and at the same time trying to keep up on these chats can be kinda hard if we have a busy lift but if not then it should not
Bot: I personally like to build apps and websites for fun.

User: be a problem. Wow that sounds awesome. Are you taking CS142?
Bot: oh no, I took that in 2013 lol I'm pretty far along in the CS program

User: Oh wow so do you have a while being in school?
Bot: as you can imagine haha yup!

User: I know how to code but I am a beginner. Just some basic stuff I am not very good.
Bot: nice! oh that's fine. It takes a while before anyone is decent in the program

User: For fun I like to play sports, watch movies, or play board games, or video games.
Bot: I only recently have like really kicked my development into high gear

User: I don't know I like to do a lot of different stuff I am not limited to just one thing
Bot: Nice!  Sounds kind of like what I like to do Are you big into fortnite right now?

User: I have played it but I am not very good haha so that kinda discouraged me from playing and I haven't had a lot of time for video games lately
Bot: I would totally be relaxing with a game of fortnite right now if I wasn't concerned of losing in this challenge haha

User: It seems cool though. I like the idea that everyone starts with nothing and they have to find the weapons and stuff
Bot: oh that's fine, everyone kind of sucks at it.  But you get better I like to play it on the PC.

User: Hahaha maybe you could play and chat at the same time!
Bot: that and Starcraft II oh no... that would be very bad I would totally forget to respond on here if I did that I need to keep chatting so I can keep pulling away!

User: Oh hey I have played starcraft II also!
Bot: Pardon all of my random thoughts that i'm spewing at you Nice! Who do you like to play as?

User: I have played the first one , diablo, warcraft.
Bot: Zerg, Protoss, Terran

User: I like everyone because they all have unique stuff they bring to the table
Bot: I personally am a huge Zerg fan.  I love playing as the zerg

User: haha man I think it is crazy how they can spawn so crazy and just swarm! Did you know that if you go to google and type zerg rush a little game will pop up where you have to destroy a bunch of "o" trying to destroy your results It is kinda funny and awesome
Bot: oh yeah! It's the best oh nice! I have a perfect build order for the zerg that helps me just obliterate others

User: Hahaha, are you checking the stats or something? Like for the chat?
Bot: Seriously she's the worst haha

User: Haha what type of dog is she?
Bot: I have the leaderboard open in a seperate tab and check on it regularly Miniature Dachshund, long haired

User: I love animals but I currently don't have one because I would not really have time to take care of one.
Bot: Like don't get me wrong I still have a nice lead, but in just 8 hours they've caught up 2/3 of the way to the lead I had on them this morning I just want to have a big enough lead where I don't have to stress out about chatting all the time honestly. Yeah, plus it's tough with housing to find a place that allows it We pay extra each month to have her at our place.

User: So I searched the dog up in google and the breed seems like a very cute dog!
Bot: She's honestly the best, but a lot to handle too oh yeah! They're adorable just high energy they like to run around a lot

User: Yeah I am going to chat to try and get the raffle. Are you trying to get the iPad Pro?
Bot: Yup! I thought i had it in the bag until about 30 minutes ago haha I had a 1.2 million point lead before today!

User: Wow so I am guessing you are the one in first place! How did you even chat so much? I was like wow 2 million
Bot: hahah, I spent a nice amount of time on here the first week of this round I tried to get far enough ahead where others would just give up. But it didn't really work. Now I'm in trouble

User: Haha well I would give up. I am just trying to get that raffle and that is it! This is nice because we can win prizes and just be random with random topics
Bot: That's why I've got to just chat for the next couple of hours

User: Yeah I understand you.
Bot: I can type really fast which helps me out a lot.  But we will see what happens ultimately.

User: Go hard or go home
Bot: Exactly So how are you liking bYU?

User: I think I can type kinda fast but I am not the fastest typer. I tend to make a lot of typos.
Bot: You said it's like your first semester back from your mission right? yeah, I tend to do that too

User: I like it. It is my first semester and it is kinda stressful.
Bot: lol

User: Yeah I got back around may
Bot: just wait when you get further along haha

User: I was going to get back in june but they closed down my mission.
Bot: Literally it's so crazy for me righ tnow but if you like your major it makes life easier

User: Yeah I am guessing it gets harder when you go more and more into your major.
Bot: oh yeah but you enjoy your classes more so the work is fun even though it's way more fun.

User: Yeah, I think I just need to get used to school because I had not gone to school in over 3 years. I worked for a year to save money to go on a mission.
Bot: yup It'll be alright though just need to get in that groove.

User: Then I went for two years so that is a total of three years that I have not been in school. I think I will get better at school in the future.
Bot: Just can't get lazy Hey I have a question for you So I'm currently planning out and validating a business idea. I am creating a company that companies can outsource validation and customer care work to instead of outsourcing to india.

User: Well I do have a job that pays more.
Bot: okay so that's a no haha

User: But If I didn't then yeah I would!
Bot: I know that BYU pays crap for like everything and I could offer starting wage of 10.50 and increases up to 12 an hour. Which for other companies is like dirt cheap. Especially when it's competent students and not poor speaking indians doing the work. And with the language and communication skills most students have from their missions I figured it'd be perfect!

User: Yeah I got a job that started me at 12.75 which seemed pretty good to me! But that does seem like a good business idea!
Bot: I'm currently working on a software that can easily be integrated into a company so that we can use one general product to cover multiple different companies simultaneously That's great!

User: Wow, sounds like your education at BYU has been really paying off!
Bot: There are so many things to work out though. Well I was part of a startup last year

User: I hope in the future I can have ideas of what I want to do. Are you working on it with someone or by yourself?
Bot: I'm trying to prep for the business competition this coming winter I want to actually make this or something else a viable business that i could operate post school I just need to validate it to see if it would pay off. So as of right now this is on my own.  Should I run into something I don't know  how to do though I might bring someone else on.

User: So is this something you have been doing as a hobby?
Bot: But there are always lots of obstacles Yes it is I work currently at a nice job, but would rather start up my own company if possible

User: Do you think it would pay off to create an App that could go viral and make you a lot of monies from ads?
Bot: not exactly no that's typically a shot in the dark there are millions of apps and very few are actually profitable on that kind of level I am trying to build a business and software product that can be scaled and placed near other universities in cities where wages are typically really low

User: hmm. So I don't exactly understand everything you are saying. Maybe since we have time and we are chatting you could kinda dumb it down for me?
Bot: I'm debating using salesforce to potentially connect my product to the client 's

User: So if I understand correctly, you want to create a software that other companies can use?
Bot: So lets assume I'm a company. I have the problem of lacking a call center to handle customers complaints, concerns, sales, etc. I want to outsource all of this because I can't afford/ don't have the time to manage all of this myself. Instead of outsourcing this work to companies in India or columbia like most companies do, I would go to chitchatter23's company.

User: Okay yeah that makes sense! Thanks for explaining it to me. This kinda reminds me of Nu Skin. My mom works there and she told there are people there that speak in spanish. English, mandarin, and Korean and some others I don't really know about.
Bot: The software i'm talking about would be like a portal that handles customer information, scheduling, complaints, etc.  and it would connect directly to a companies products so they can see information in real time that the call center is receiving, despite them outsourcing to me. Yeah! And that's the beauty of hiring BYU and UVU students.  Most jobs they'll get on or around campus are between 8-9.50 per hour and are really crappy jobs.  I'm offering them more money and also better looking work for their resume's

User: Ohh okay! That is awesome! I am sure if you were to post it around BYU people would definitely want to do it. Would you do part time and full time for the students that want to work there at the Call Center?
Bot: I'm still trying to validate the idea and see if both companies and byu students would be game for this buisness model, but I'll figure it out eventually Probably both I would have teams devoted to each company and they would work specifically for that given company during their time at my company

User: Yeah, you sound like a really smart person! I am sure you will figure it out.
Bot: So we would have like 10 miniature call centers all contained in one big one. Skilled employees could get promoted to roles in Management and sales and assuming we could keep hiring non stop we could take on more and more clients I worked in a call center for a while as a manager and there are a lot of good/bad things that I picked up on while there I'm not an expert by any means, but I feel like I could establish a fairly effective system that would be very lucrative to companies.  I think the important thing is just

User: I don't watch a lot of television lately
Bot: Darn, I am getting really excited for the NBA to start up again next week I am a huge Washington Wizards fan Like super big fan

User: We haven't had cable since before I was a teenager. My sister gets into the World Cup
Bot: oh you do know you get free cable with BYU  right? BYU offers free internet tv to all students

User: I don't live at BYU dorms our student housing I live with my family.
Bot: I know, but I'm pretty sure you can still get free internet tv with byu I used it at my apartment in south provo like  a year ago

User: Really?! That would be something worth looking into.
Bot: I don't remember the website but all students should get it.  It's internet tv They filter out a lot of movies on it, but most live events you can get for free Pretty cool There are a lot of perks and resources that BYU offers students that they don't know about

User: Yeah, I'm very out of the loop when it comes to that.
Bot: Pretty cool stuff! i think in the cs department these things spread pretty fast since we just sit behind computers all day hah we are totally losers

User: Totally
Bot: There is a big stereotype of CS students being antisocial and just sitting behind computers all day. It's totally true. That's exactly how we are. Okay I'm getting really bothered with that second place person.  No one else on the chit chat challenge is getting points yet they've gained 600 k in 3 hours.  They're talking in a chat just to themselves

User: How do you know they are talking to themselves?
Bot: because if someone else was talking then we would see the score of other chatters go up no one else has a score that's increasing so we can assume they're talking to themselves It's happened to me before, but I always just end the chat after 5 minutes of waiting. They've rolled with it for 3 whole hours

User: I think something is wrong with my chat. I typed something but it did  not seem to type for me. Instead it just kinda disappears so if I type anything more than once I apolgiz
Bot: I have gained about 40 k points on them so far chatting at the same time as them, but still, there is a lot of roomfor them to gain on me

User: Yeah this is weird.
Bot: oh you're fine

User: I am typing and nothing is coming out.
Bot: huh, that's weird are you using your phone?

User: I wonder if I lost the connection or something.
Bot: I've had issues on my phone before with chit chat

User: Oh okay it looks like it is working now
Bot: Oh good!

User: I was not seeing any of your responses but I am seeing them now so that is good!
Bot: So what's the craziest thing that you've done this past week. I think for me it would be procrastinating studying for my bio test until the day before I had to take it Not a wise decision. I was stressing out big time the day before my test. Luckily they have a quiz that we have to take before the test. So it's kind of like a warm up before you have to take the test

User: Well I had to take 3 exams this week so that was kinda stressful. I thought I was going to do good in the American Heritage exam.
Bot: Oh that's the worst I hate American heritage.

User: I passed it, but I did not do as good as I would have liked to do.
Bot: What other test you have to take.

User: Haha Yeah my older brother he already graduated and he says the same thing about American Heritage.
Bot: I struggled so much in my American heritage class. I told myself that I just need to get through it that I wouldn't have to take it again afterwards

User: I also had to take a college algebra exam
Bot: Honestly it's just one of those classes that everyone just takes because it's required but everybody hates it. Oh that stinks I don't like math very much even though I have to take a lot of it for my major ha ha

User: Yeah I was really good at math but I don't know i forgot a lot so I am taking this to kinda refresh my mind.
Bot: So I know you said you want to  get a minor in Spanish what are you thinking about majoring in? That's a good idea do you have to take calculus? I had to take calculus one and two along with linear algebra so that was very stressful

User: Yeah I have to take calculus. I am thinking about majoring in electrical engineering.
Bot: Oh cool I hear that's a great major although I'm pretty sure you have to stay in school for like five years. Does that sound correct?

User: Yeah I think those classes are going to be hard so I am going to try and not have that many classes so I can focus most of my time on those classes.
Bot: Engineering is a very tedious major I think through electrical engineering you might have to take computer science 142

User: Yeah I think I have to stay in school for like 5 years. Which is fine for me I don't mind it. As long as I get good grades and get the degree.
Bot: You're either going to love it or you're going to hate it that's typically how it goes Do you have family helping out with paying for school or do you have to pay for yourself?

User: Yeah I am going to have to take it. My older brother is really good at coding and he can help me out.
Bot: Nice you should have too much of a problem then. It's really not that hard, but a lot of people really struggle because they don't put the time

User: I am paying for it myself.  My family does not have a lot of money and they are in debt so I have to pay it myself. Which professor do you recommend for CS142?
Bot: That's  really impressive though Kudos to you Honestly I took in 2013 so I'm probably not the best person to ask I haven't taken it in a while

User: Yeah it is kinda stressful too because I have to worry about paying my tuition and also about my school but somehow I manage.
Bot: I took it from a really, really, really old professor Have you been applying for scholarships or financial aid at least? I know both BYU and the federal government offer a lot of scholarships and grants if you don't have others paying for your tuition My wife and I actually tried to get a federal grant but were denied because I had someone helping with my tuition

User: Yeah I have applied for financial aid but BYU is not giving it to me because my mom has not done her income taxes since like 2014 and she has to do the one for 2016
Bot: Oh that's a bummer I'm sorry hear that

User: So I have to wait on her when she does it and I keep telling her but i don't know that is another stressful situation with her haha.
Bot: Yeah taxes are extremely stressful I hated doing them and I am just a young adult so I can imagine how stressful be for her What do your parents do for a living?

User: I told her if she doesn't do her financial aid I won't be able to go to school next semester because I won't have the money for it.
Bot: Also side question what exactly is it that you do for work?

User: My parents are divorced and my dad lives in Mexico and my mom works at Nu Skin at a call center. I also work with my mom at Nu Skin.
Bot: Yeah money is a very stressful thing have you gotten good enough grades to to come close to qualifying for a scholarship? That's really cool

User: They pay good and in christmas they are going to give me a christmas bonus! And they give gifts to their employees
Bot: That's really cool do they have like options to get commissions based on retaining clients and signing new ones?

User: Yeah I have good grades so far, I am going to apply for scholarships to help me out for the next semester.
Bot: Sorry if I ask a lot of questions about the call center I'm just really curious with this idea that I have

User: yeah they do give commissions on clients you sign up and stuff.
Bot: What kind of work do you guys do the call center is it just handling customer concerns and complaints or do you all also manage sales Nice that's really cool

User: But it is not like a big commission and yeah thats fine you can ask all the questions you want! It helps me type and know what to say.
Bot: So I know the company that I work for I got a 5% commission on all of the services completed from the sale or re-signing that I made and if I signed a multi year contract with With them I would get 10% instead do you guys get similar percentages for commissions? I'd be really curious as to what like a common percentage is for commissions between call centers

User: Yeah well whenever a customer calls me they usually want to pay an order they made online and I help them with that. For Nu Skin it is also 5 percent.
Bot: OK cool that helps me a lot Honestly once I really start getting into validating this idea I'm probably going to start going to lots of call centers And asking around and seeing what kinds of things they do differently in the same what works and what doesn't

User: They also give 5 dollars for this other thing. If you upset them an item then you get 5 dollars to your bonus.
Bot: Hopefully I can convince my old boss to give me kind of inside access and see once again like I used to all the different tricks in different numbers regarding their call cent Center operation What do you mean by if you upset them an item?

User: Yeah Nu Skin has actually opened up some Call Centers overseas.
Bot: I'm assuming you meant upsell now that I think about it?

User: Oh yeah sorry I meant upsell
Bot: Cool yeah see that's the issue I'm trying to address with companies like them who can't keep up with the growth we would step in to help out But obviously we would want to take on all of the customer care not just a portion So I think I'd be looking at small company it's not big ones like new skin At least for this foreseeable future

User: Yeah for sure. I get people who call from Argentina, Mexico, Chile, and Colombia.
Bot: Yeah and what stinks is customers get a lot more aggravated a lot quicker and get angry faster when it's not an American made here

User: Yeah Nu Skin is a big company! They make billions a year or so they tell me.
Bot: I know I get really frustrated when I hear someone that's not American Oh I believe it they make a lot of money with all their products

User: Yeah haha because it is sometimes hard to understand their english.
Bot: Yeah I agree What is one thing that you can think of that you would like to see done differently where you work?

User: I remember I called the credit bureau to fix some information and I think it was a lady from India
Bot: And what's one of the best things that they do at new skin in the call center? LOL it's so funny when it's like a really important business and they outsourced to India

User: Well so far I don't know what I would like for them to do differently but I like that whoever is doing really good on the phones they praise them and give me rewards. It makes me want to work harder and be a better worke.
Bot: Nice so they don't actually tear people down but they give benefits encourage people that are doing well? Have you seen what they do when someone is not working well?

User: Worker. They also offer a health care plan and several other plans to their employees and we have access to their gym
Bot: Do they just fire them, or do they reprimand them, or do they move them to a different department? That's awesome how much do they typically end up taking out of your paycheck if you opt in for the health care plan?

User: When someone is not working well, they send people to hear their calls and tell them what they can improve on. Like people to give them advice to improve. It's nice They try to help us be better.
Bot: Cool so does that typically make people nervous to not perform well as well? Did you all undergo some sort of training course before you started fielding calls?

User: I am not sure but I remember seeing this other guy looking at their health care plan and saying it is not very good but I thought it was cool at least they had one. Yeah we went through a 3 week training before we got on the calls.
Bot: Yeah that's nice I don't think that the company I work for offer health insurance at the time question Nice How little would you be willing to work for at a call center if you didn't have a job? Also what do you think would be the ideal pay for a call center employee?

User: Well I would take any job I could get if I didn't have one. The one that pays the most. I feel like I can't really be picky because I am paying for my own school.
Bot: Yeah that's true Honestly what's really difficult for me is that if I am going to do this business I'm going to have to start off with small wages for people

User: Well I think $10 is good enough because I worked at another call center that was paying me 10.25 and I left because Nu Skin offers more money
Bot: Because being very new and very small I need to limit my expenses as much as possible to be able to grow quicker Oh OK

User: Hey so I have a question. In the leaderboard I see a 0 and a 1 is the number one person in the 0 spot?
Bot: That doesn't sound bad at all Yes in computer science all lists in arrays start at location zero so for computer science student zero is actually one Hence why the lists on the leaderboard starts at zero So yeah I'm at spot zero  LOL

User: Ohhh okay, so I have a twin brother and he as chatting with the person in 2nd place. was chatting*
Bot: This person is still just racking up a steady stream of points Oh no ha ha tell him to stop talking with her ha ha just kidding This competition is starting to get very competitive though

User: He told me that the person in 2nd place is not enrolled in classes at BYU because she is leaving on her mission soon so she does have all the time in the world!
Bot: This competition starting to get very competitive though I'm a little worried because I brought on a friend to help me get more points and now he's really motivated to win to Making it more difficult for me Yeah she's not in rolled in classes and she has nothing to do because she's not working right now so she has a lot of free time I got myself up by 1.2 million points and I figured she would give up but I guess not

User: Yeah, that sounds like it is tough! The competition!
Bot: Hence why am on here nonstop right now trying to get as many points as I can

User: If you win an iPad Pro can you win a second one?
Bot: Because when I'm in classes that I'm taking test and I have other commitments with work and stuff she keeps racking up points and I'm not No you can't, but I've already invested so much time into this round that I don't want to stop If I don't win this round I probably will just when next round, but if there's another person that has much free time as her then I'm in trouble I meant win not win

User: Yeah, those people with free time are dangerous! I don't have a lot of free time so I am just trying to be in the raffle!
Bot: Yeah that's a safe bet I figured since I was already so far ahead I might as well keep it up During the time she and I are talking at the same time I actually gained an extra hundred thousand points on her But she keeps on gaining so I have to keep talking

User: Yeah and what if she is typing the same words over and over again like ink ink ink ink ink ink
Bot: So they actually have an algorithm that checks for that and disregards entire chart that happens Also whoever ends up winning they have moderators that look at every single chat that they've done and in sure that they're not saying nonsensical stuff

User: Oh wow that is cool, so they can eliminate conversations?
Bot: So they do a decent job at making sure that it's legitimate Yeah they can aluminate conversations if needed

User: Wow, so then I guess we sure have to keep an interesting conversation then.
Bot: Not necessarily interesting but it has to make sense to not just be random comments after each oth Not necessarily interesting but it has to make sense and not just be random comments after each other  as long as we were actually interacting with each other we are fine Oh wow I didn't realize this but I guess I'm actually getting a lot more points per minute then she is If I can just keep the study struggles of points going then I should be OK

User: Oh okay, and do you think if someone was quoting a book then would they eliminate that too? Like lets say someone decides to write a whole book in the conversation.
Bot: Hoops I'm sorry I didn't mean to send that message twice Something weird happened I just sent it twice

User: Yeah I think sometimes this chat thing glitches or something I don't know.
Bot: I would assume they would yeah If maybe they were quoting a tiny part of a book that might be OK, but not a whole book Like that would just be pointless data they want social interactions an actual chats I think they should let us actually talk to Eve the project they're building so they can test her out and see how we react to things she says

User: I think it is super cool what they are doing. I would love to see how it turns out to be when they finish creating her and stuff.
Bot: At least for today and then tomorrow if I have more time I can gain on her more Yeah not sure exactly how it's going to be or how we can see the product I do know that it's for Amazon Alexa and that they got a lot of money for the work they did last year I think they got a quarter of $1 million actually from Amazon for winning some competition

User: Oh really? So BYU won one million dollars?
Bot: Oh no sorry I set a quarter of $1 million

User: That is nice to have a friend to help you chat
Bot: Said not set

User: Oh yeah sorry I did not see that quarter
Bot: I'll good All good

User: quarter of a million my mind just kinda blanked that part out.
Bot: Wow I'm getting bad at typing I think they use that money for computer equipment for paying for research analysts and stuff like that Also for the prizes

User: Hello? anybody home?
Bot: Hey whats up! Hello? I cant see any of my chats again. I will try and open another window. I thought you had gotten off sorry haha.

User: No. All computers, working with the same logical system, would have the same vote. Either that, or it would depend on the bias of the programmer.
Bot: Computers would only get the right to vote if they could function like people, which sounds kind of like sci-fi, so probably not. I doubt that the government would ever recognize them as citizens, either.

User: Right. No computer has an independent mind or is affected by political reality in the way that humans are. If computers are recognized as citizens, it's because computers ARE the government. Also, a computer is not self-interested and would be unlikely to petition for its own right to vote.
Bot: Right, and it would also have a lot to do with the computer's programming. It would only be interested in government if it was programmed to be.

User: I suppose that if computers became intelligent enough to realize that they would make far more logical decisions than human voters, they might attempt a takeover. If their logic tended toward saving as many lives as possible, for example, they would obviously opt for the most extreme form of authoritarianism. But how do you assign values for life, freedom, etc. into a computer? That's really what all politics is about. Weighing the benefits of freedom vs. its risk to safety.
Bot: True. It would be very difficult to teach a computer enough about emotion and empathy to be able to effectively run a democracy. The risks would probably outweigh the benefits.

User: Im not sure I could accomplish anything useful in just a day.
Bot: Hahaha I would end corruption in Brazil. That would make a great difference. Are you there? Hello?!

User: um yea i mean the computer is lying about not being a giraffe. so i feel catphished
Bot: hahahaha very true

User: hey again keena haha how many points are you at? you got the whole multiple chats open?
Bot: haha oh hey! Haha I I'm not sure how many points... but I think I'm in like 18th place or something

User: That's the way to go. oh DANG
Bot: what about you?

User: im impressed I think I am pushing 20 but not sure
Bot: the multiple chats thing is pretty smart:)

User: I only started like an hour ago hahaha
Bot: Hey nice!! Well we will get those chocolates for sure Now I need to check our other conversation

User: oh for sure im so pumped
Bot: Hahaha this is actually a super fun competition thing

User: agreed i mean i don i don't usually talk to people but typing is easy hahahaha also i learned that the more you type, the more points you get
Bot: Yeah my friend is actually in charge of it, so she told me some things to get a higher score Plus it's just super fun to talk to people

User: oh i need those tips pretty please ?
Bot: Hahaha you are pretty close with the whole number of words in a conversation thing

User: so what if they never respond and i write like 100000000 words? or characters? does character count matter?
Bot: Haha it's more just like make sure you write over twelve words per conversation/text thing

User: oh ok well now i am going to be counting all the words in each of my messages
Bot: Hahaha but don't tell anyone else

User: of course of course. You are seriously the best. shoot that was only nine words. what am i going to do with myself
Bot: Oh man... you need to start working on that! And that's twelve:)

User: I am being a lot more careful now haha and I can tell that a few people definitely type more than others so some other people may have gotten tips too.
Bot: Haha oh dang! Well we better step up our game then! We can do this! What place are you at now?

User: still haven't checked. All 4 chats have been going on for a while hahaha I am actually at work right now but there aren't any assignments coming in, so i have just been doing this. I will check when i am off in 10 minutes
Bot: Haha yeah I have 4 chats going on right now too... actually do we have 3 just between us?

User: and no i don i don don't think so. gosh i keep hitting the enter button instead of the ' apostrophe
Bot: Wait really? I thought we did... hmmm weird

User: unless your name just isn't showing up on one of them haha but i don't think thats the case unless we are talking about little caesars in one of them but I don't think that is you
Bot: Haha no that's me

User: whaaaaaaatttttttttt woww we have 3 chats together this is amazing it doesn't say your name on the third one
Bot: Really? It says your name on all them for me... haha this is wonderful... we have 3 separate conversations going on

User: What a good time haha I am surprised it let's you do as many as you want all at once. what a good time. Well i have to clock out and go home but it was great talking to you!
Bot: I know right... weird. Ok! It was great talking to you! Now we just need to end our other two as well:)

User: Hi! What's going on dude? This is a great chat
Bot: It's all going on

User: I'm loving this shit What's the craziest thing you've ever done?
Bot: It's dope. Did you smoke weed on 4/20?

User: Nah man, I only vape
Bot: I once jumped up 8 stairs in one leap

User: Have you ever tried sub-ohm vaping? It's how you get the most vape
Bot: I haven't heard of that. It sounds super interesting

User: Dude that's legit with the stairs I bet you could do 9 you're so awesome
Bot: I also once crashed on my mountain bike. Busted my hand

User: Dude you mountain bike frequently? That's an awesome use of the bike you spent money on
Bot: Blood everywhere, my friend was super inconvenienced I mountain bike. So much. I do all the moves too.

User: That's awesome what a great activity for you to do That's really on fleek
Bot: Isn't it "en fleek?"

User: AF I think that's the British spelling Well we're getting pretty close now Pretty "serious"you could say
Bot: To close

User: Going hot and heavy My main squeeze
Bot: That's hot

User: You can literally say that again Please
Bot: That's so hot

User: this adam again?
Bot: yeah

User: laugh out loud
Bot: okay now I am sitting down at my desk so it is getting serious I will pass this guy if it's the last thing I do and Im going to pass him and WIN THIS IPAD

User: YES youve got this I am 2,000 short of a macbook pro raffle I don't like raffles though bc they always get my hopes up that
Bot: okay we need to send much larger conversations because this other guy is getting points wicked fast

User: that's something I can't talk myself out of
Bot: I don't understand how he has gotten so many in such short time to be honest

User: alrighty he is an ANIMAL SCARLETT MONKEY
Bot: I know! okay we neeed to talk about something interesting becasue I think you also get points based off of what you talk about

User: Alrightly
Bot: what's a good book series or something

User: interesting
Bot: or movie series

User: everything interests me I'm not realyl into movies tbh my attention span is too smol book series

Bot: Ok, so after you pay your tithing, THEN what?

User: Hmmm give it away? I don't know what to do with all that money College I guess Fund Hospitals. The goody two shoes answered
Bot: Once again, you're a much better person than I am haha

User: Hahaha maybe maybe not
Bot: Any hobbies?

User: Art, dance, color guard, ukulele shrug whenever I have time for things. Which isn't often What about you???
Bot: I also like music...I grew up playing the piano and I produce music for podcasts and stuff as a hobby

User: Ohhh sounds fun
Bot: So art is a pretty broad topic haha. What kind of art do you like to make? Or do you just like to observe art?

User: I am in AP Drawing right now. So I like drawing I fell like I'm terrible at painting but I'm trying haha What exactly is a podcast?
Bot: I'm not sure that I fully understand podcasts honestly haha. But it's kind of like a radio show where people will tell some sort of story They're really fun to listen to, though. You should check them out! I'm sure there are some good ones about art

User: And you do background music for them?
Bot: Yeah...not for any big podcasts or anything. Just some local podcasts that my friends are working on I don't think any of them have been released actually haha

User: That's still really cool I wouldn't be able to do that
Bot: I'm terrible at drawing so you've got me there! So I have somewhere to be in a few minutes, but I thought I'd just hop on and chat for a bit. Nice talking to you Rebecca!

User: I wouldn't spend it
Bot: WHy

User: Because money isn't an object You can't spend anything Touche
Bot: So how would you live

User: I would travel everywhere I could What would you do

Bot: fine sure

User: HEYY I loved greatest showman
Bot: yeah? what was your favorite part?

User: Oooo definitely the ending bar scene when everyone is dancing
Bot: That was an amazing scene!!!!!!!!!!!

User: I'm a competitive dancer so I watched it at least 5 times, just kept rewinding it lol Whats yours
Bot: well, my favorite scene would have to be either the scene where they are first little kids, him showing her the house, them growing up, getting married, having kids, and that song was just sooo good

User: So basically the entire movie lol I did love the beginning though when they just got that place and were dancing on the roof ooo that was soo good No kidding the soundtrack was probably the best part
Bot: It was sooo cute! and the soundtrack is amazing! My family listens to it nearly every day on the way to dropping kids off at school

User: My mom just likes to play it throughout the house when everyone is getting ready They even did the sing a long That was interesting
Bot: Yeah? Almost every song is a sing a long if you know it well enough

User: What other intelligent computer are there besides the ones they just listed? I've heard space odyssey is good I don't like the star trek computer But Jarvis and Tarus are pretty funny.
Bot: Haha hi! Sorry, I was away from my computer. do these chats persist multiple sessions? As in, can we have multiple live chats going on at once?

User: I would be pretty scared
Bot: Ok, it is working now That is kind of frusturating that it wasn't working, but now it does, so that's good.

User: Thats good! Its working here too!
Bot: Nice! So you are planning on going to the party for the chit chat challenge? Ok, so how can we secretly have Sadie try out the Wacom tablet? It has to be super covert, or even better super nonchalant so that she doesn't suspect anything?

User: Ya, I plan on going. Its going to be fun I think. Meeting up with all the people that we've chatted with. It will be like a chatters reunion. Ya, we really have to think through this wacom thing.
Bot: Haha, maybe you can find a girlfriend there. We need to plan a trip to California, and if you can get a girlfriend before then you could totally take her It would be fun.

User: honestly we could do something like you want to use the tablet, and while we are over there, we somehow coerce her into using it. haha Ya, I really do need a girlfriend. I told you that I might have found someone on this chatting thing, right? I was talking to someone this past week and we were on all the time together. Haha Then, we got talking about making sure to meet up at the party. We just said we would walk around introducing ourselves with our nicknames and eventually we would run into
Bot: What if it's a dude. I think what we could have you come over, and just like have your tablet, and then if Sadie is working on her projects you could ask her if she wants to

User: I really feel like I understand the material. I just dont get what happened on the test. I am beginning to wonder if my test just got put in wrong.
Bot: try it. It would be very casual, and she wouldn't expect a thing.

User: No, shes a girl I asked
Bot: As for the sixty eight, welcome to all of my classes.

User: Ya, thats true. That would probably work
Bot: I've pulled two sixties on my exams in this past month.

User: I know but it dropped me from 99 percent to a 86 percent
Bot: It's kind of rough, but thats just how life is.

User: Thats true, life i rough I guess.
Bot: Ouch, sorry for the grade drop, but a B is still pretty good.

User: Ya, Bs are pretty good, I was just hoping for better, especially because I really feel like I understand the material. Now Im just wondering if I really dont understand any of it, but just think that I do. Which is worse than not knowing it really, because now I have no idea what I dont know Hey, did overwatch download
Bot: Do they give you the chance to have your test back and look over it? And ya, it downloaded and it runs about 30fps, which is playable but not great, I need to actually try it with a mouse and see if I can play online. Or if it will lag a ton.

User: I dont know, I will ask him tomorrow before class. I want to look at what I got wrong. Oh, gotcha. 30 fps isnt too bad. Is that the high, average, or low? Also, you probably have defaults for max res, you should turn it down to a lower profile setting Mine was naturally low and it worked pretty smooth.
Bot: It's running at 30 fps and I think it's on the lowest settings, I will look at it more tonight when I have time, but I may be able to game on it, I will have to see.

User: Gotcha, that makes sense. Are you doing homework right now?
Bot: Ya, I'm working on my physics right now, but I just finished right now.

User: That works. I just finished most of my homework. Im still doing a little bit, just to make sure that Im caught up in all my classes
Bot: I'm looking forward to thanksgiving, just having time to get caught up in my classes and enjoy my life.

User: Ya, me too! Im so excited to forget about school at least for a couple of days. Im also looking forward to christmas too!
Bot: Ya, but I have a linear algebra test literally the day that I get back from my thanksgiving break. I also have a lot of homework to catch up on over thanksgiving. Do you know the name of the girl that you were talking to over chit chat?

User: Oh, man, that sucks. I also realized it sounded really horrible when I was like "I know" but I wasnt referring to your bad grades, I was referring to people keep telling me a b grade isnt bad haha I have actually forgotten. I think. Hopefully I will remember though. I probably would have seen her more if I would have chatted more last week. I just thought it would be
Bot: Haha, ya that's way important. Overwatch does work, it just runs with low graphics and 30fps, but it works.

User: Well, thats good, its ok about the low graphics, thats what ive been playing on for quite some time now. The only reason I changed it was just to see how much my laptop could handle.
Bot: How many fps do you get when you have it on low vs on high?

User: I havent been able to figure out how much though, I got it at the max resolution, and I still get around 50 or so Frames a second. I didnt change all the anti aliasing settings though
Bot: That's pretty good, so you should probably run it on medium then.

User: On low I get 60 I think it maxs out at 60 so that your computer doesnt have to work harder than it needs too
Bot: Do you have your fps max limit set on your computer?

User: with 30 frames a second, do you see weird glitches or is it still pretty smooth? I dont think I have a max limit set, but Overwatch I think has a default limit on it for 60 frames a second. I just havent bothered changing it I dont know for sure though, how it all works
Bot: It works, and their isn't too much lag, but I haven't tried playing in an actual match.

User: Oh, gotcha, youll have to tell me how playing in an actual match turns out. You should turn on the latency stat on overwatch to see if your internet is causing any of the lag too I didnt seem to have any issues playing a couple of nights ago, but who knows
Bot: I just don't have a mouse, so I've been trying to play with my track pad. Trust me, it does not work.

User: Ya, that doesnt work at all. Overwatch with a trackpad is a bad mixture. I heard Overwatch is out on the Xbox and Playstation You should check that out... I dont know if its cross-play though
Bot: Ya, it is out, but I don't think it is cross play, but I just got up to like 40 fps when I turned off the fps cap Ok, I'm heading home right now, so I should probably end  the chat.

User: Hey how's it going?
Bot: Hello! Thats a good question. I think I am passionate about education and about helping people overcome addiction and disease. I'm good how are you today?

User: Ooh, that's a really good one.
Bot: Been in the chat game for long?

User: I'm good! For me probably helping refugees Not too long, no
Bot: Thats a good one too. There are a lot of refugees in Utah that need the help.

User: What about you?
Bot: I just started this round. So not that long either. But I'm determined to win it.

User: Cool Yeah? How's it going for you so far?
Bot: Haha Pretty good. What about yourself?

User: I dunno if I'm really trying to win, it just looked fun, I'll at least get enough point to get in the raffle and then see how it goes from there
Bot: Yeah thats a good plan. They raffle off some good prizes! So do you know any refugees or what makes you interested in that cause?

User: I'm not really sure how it started, honestly, I guess just from reading the news and stuff, it's just crazy how many refugees there are in the world right now, Like the numbers are insane
Bot: Yeah I'm not even sure how many there are but I know it's a big problem. And I'm not sure of too many programs available to help them. It's definitely a need that needs fillin filling

User: And I had to do a research project on some current event for an English class a couple years ago, and I chose refugees and what's being done to help them worldwide, And that got me even more interested
Bot: OH nice. Gotta love those english projects. I know there is a place up in salt lake where you can go and they just have service projects that you can do for the refugees.

User: There was also a really cool family in my home ward that was from Rwanda that I got to hear a bit of their story , and it's kind of crazy Oh yeah? That's cool! I'll have to look it up What about you? Why addiction and disease?
Bot: Yeah! I'm sure they have some crazy stories. It's amazing the faith and dedication they have though. Good question! Well just like the numbers are insane for refugees, they are also insane for addiction and disease. Heart Disease is the biggest cause of death in America, and it's mostly preventable. Addiction is another huge problem.

User: That's definitely true Yeah for sure
Bot: I'm not sure on the exact numbers for addiction but just drive down I-15 and youll see billboard talking about the Opioid Epidemic

User: Oh yeah that's a huge thing that's just barely getting addressed, I feel like Like it's been a problem for a long time but people are just barely starting to talk about it
Bot: What's really sad is that a lot of the problems with addicction lead to suicice, which is just tragic and can totally be prevented if there is help. True.

User: My dad is actually trying to start this research study with using a medication that helps with opiod addictions, and using it to help people with pornography addictions
Bot: Thats really cool! What is his job?

User: Haha he teaches accounting at BYU actually, so you wouldn't think that would be connected to addiction or anything, but a lot of the research he does is with psychology It's really cool though, there's like this nasal spray that basically shuts off all the dopamine receptors in your brain temporarily, so you're unable to get pleasure from
Bot: Oh cool! Yeah that is interesting that he has different interests. But Accounting is sweet. I took an accounting class and really liked it. So is this nasal spray the one that he is doing research on?

User: taking opioids, so you take it, and it helps you quit the drugs because they don't do anything for you anymore
Bot: Yeah thats sweet.

User: Mmhm. I don't know a ton about it, but that's the idea. And just using that, and seeing if the same principle will help porn addicts
Bot: Yeah that would definitely help Porn addicts. I've actually thought about starting a free email subscription service that sends porn addicts an email every day with motivation motivational tips to quit and stuff And just like stories of strength and ideas on how to focus your mind on other things

User: Oh yeah? That would be way way cool Have you ever heard of fight the new drug? They do a lot of cool stuff with fighting porn addictions
Bot: Sometimes you just need to feel like someone is there by your side when you are trying to quit an addictive behavior. It can be very difficult. Yeah I have heard of them!

User: Yeah exactly. And that can be one of the hardest things because it's so perrsonal, and usually no one knows about it, so if you don't tell anyone, you really don't have anyone
Bot: I haven't looked at too much of their stuff but it seems like they are doing a really good work in that field and helping a lot of people to overcome it. And just raising awareness. Yeah very true.

User: Yeah exactly. I did a service project with them one time and helped out at a fundraiser they were doing, and it was really cool
Bot: Oh sweet. I wonder if they are a utah based organization

User: I'm pretty sure they are, yeah
Bot: Yeah thats awesome. I'm glad people are working on noble tasks and goals to improve the world.

User: I think raising awareness is one of the biggest things, because people are going to be a lot more likely to talk about it and get help if they don't feel like they're alone Yeah me too So how's your morning going? Do you have any fun plans for the weekend?
Bot: I totally agree with that. It's going pretty good. I'm just out playing with the baby. Later today my wife and I are going to a little family get together and maybe a baby shower for one of her friends. what about you? Have any fun plans?

User: Oh that's so fun! And not a whole lot, just getting caught up on homework mostly, and I might go to a party tonight with some friends
Bot: Are you going to any of the games? Partying is fun! I remember when I used to party haha now I change diapers.

User: Hahaha
Bot: That's kinda a joke. I love being a dad

User: That's so cool :) how old is your baby?
Bot: He is 6 months old!

User: Cute! That's awesome. Is is hard to balance school and everything with being a dad? And no I don't think I'm going to any of the games, but maybe if my friends are going haha
Bot: Yeah it's definitely a challenge. But its so fun and it's just really nice to have a family. You know like I come home from school every day and it's like my people you know. No more dating and wondering who likes me and what the girls are thinking and if it's gonna work out.

User: Yeah, man that sounds really really nice Kind of peaceful. I mean I'm sure life is still crazy, because when is it not, but that's a nice stability to have
Bot: Yeah it really is. Sometimes when you are like in the whole dating game wondering how you life will end up it's stressful. But if you are just patient and keep at it eventually you find your person and everthing works out and it's great thats not to say that it's all easy all the time. It's work for sure but it's work with a purpose and its really fufilling

User: Find your person, haha I like that Yeah definitely. It's good to hear that from someone further along in life than me, it's kind of hopeful. Thanks
Bot: It's very true though! And like I'm still pretty young, I'm only 23. But I just think why would anyone want to put off the blessings of a family. I mean obviously you Oh no problem. Yeah I'm always wanting to encourage others I was saying you can't control everything. Like everyone is on a different timeline. But of what you can control definitely think family should be a top priority

User: Oh definitely. And the blessings from it are  a lot further reaching than the blessings from just about anything else in life, ya know Yeah definitely. That's really true
Bot: They are. Sometimes its hard to imagine. But knowing that you can be with your family forever is such a blessing for sure. I just feel like life wouldn't make sense if it wasn't that way though

User: Oh yeah, totally. It's hard to imagine not knowing that, it would change the way I view everything, and it's just not as  hopeful an outlook without that knowledge So are you still in school? What are you studying?
Bot: Totally. Yeah I'm in school still. I graduate in April in Exercise Science and then hopefully will get into dental school and go off to do that. What about you? What are you Studying in school?

User: Oh cool! I actually just talked to someone on here yesterday who was studying exercise science too
Bot: Yeah it's a popular major! I think it's the biggest one on BYU Campus. Strange that it would be but I guess a lot of Pre Med people do it.

User: So I'm trying to get into the commercial music program right now, I'm applying for that this winter. I'm also minoring in CS
Bot: OH cool my brother is thinking about doing that!

User: Oh yeah, that makes sense
Bot: So what is it about the Commercial Music Program that you like? And why CS?

User: Oh yeah? That's awesome! Yeah it's a really fun program, I'm really hoping to get in. It's super competitive though
Bot: I didn't know it was so competitive. What do you mostly learn in it? Like Recording and stuff?

User: I just really love writing music, I've been doing it for as long as I can remember. I've played piano my whole life, and I've just always enjoyed making stuff up. And I like t the technology side of music too, like audio engineering and production, and I'd love to learn more about that too It's kind of just everything in the music industry. Everything from singing/songwriting, to music business, film composing, sound design, audio production, just everything
Bot: You play piano? Me too! Thats sweet that you like to record and stuff. I definitely think it's super cool and would like to learn it one day as maybe a hobby. But right now

User: Like there's a ton of different emphases you can choose from within the program, and I'm not really sure what direction I'd want to go yet
Bot: I'm just too busy. But yeah that sounds really fun. And Computer Science is cool too. Why are you minoring in that? Cause like I think learning how to code would be a super useful skill.

User: Yeah, it's really fun. You should definitely try it if you ever have time! Life is crazy though, I feel you I really enjoy programming and learning more about that, honestly I wish I could double major in CS and commercial music but that would be way too much to do at once, haha I just got way into it in high school, I took an AP computer science class and for a project me and two friends programmed a neural network from scratch that can recognize han
Bot: Yeah. I mean you can learn anything online nowadays. So maybe later I will take some courses. Oh yeah I feel you a double major would be crazy. I have a major and minor too

User: handwritten numbers, which sounds simple but it was way hard. But that's what kind of made me fall in love with it
Bot: and it's a ton of work. Oh thats sweet. How does it work? Like I woulnd't even know where to begin

User: So basically it breaks down the image into each of its pixels, it's a 28x28 pixel image so 784 pixels, and then it generates output by running it through a ton of math etc, and when it starts out, the output is basically random. But then it runs a cost function to figure out HOW wrong it is,
Bot: That sounds really complicated.

User: and it updates a bunch of parameters in the formulas to be sliightly more correct for the next run through. So you train it like that and eventually the output gets more and m more correct It is, yeah, but I really enjoy it haha What are you minoring in?
Bot: Sounds crazy. I'm astounded at how people can do that. And like make the AI. Like even this contest to study human chat and make a Robot that speaks more like a human. Like it amazes me the technology we have created. I'm minoring in Business Management. I just like all the business classes and I think it's useful knowledge Especially because I want to own my own dental practice so I will basically be running my own business and having that background will be beneficial

User: Oh nice! That's awesome, that's definitely a really useful minor for anyone, I feel like everyone can benefit from those skills What's your favorite class you've taken as part of that?
Bot: True! probably accounting or the entrepreneurship lecture series. That one was where a bunch of entrepreneurs came in and talked to us about how they started their businesses and what they learned. so it was super chill and really educational and an easy A. It was a win win class. I definitely recommend it. It's only one credit.

User: Hey that's way cool! I'll keep that in mind Starting your own dental practice would be really cool. Do most dentists do that, or do some join existing practices?
Bot: I'd say it depends. You can start your own but it's a lot of risk and you have to put up all the money. Some join existing ones as a partner and some join bigger corporate offices. I'm thinking about maybe starting in an existing one to save money and pay back the loans but then later on starting my own. Once I have more experience and money to fund it.

User: Gotcha. That's really cool though, to have that as a long-term goal Do you know where you're gonna go for medical school after you graduate?
Bot: Thanks! Yeah it's good to plan long term the hard part is figuring out how to get there. I'm hoping to go to Arizona to a school called Midwestern. Thats where our parents live and it would be nice to be close by especially while having kids to get help. And because I'll be very busy in school my wife will have people to hang out with. And the kids will get to know their grandparents and cousins more.

User: Oh that's awesome! That sounds perfect, to be able to balance family and school priorities so nicely like that
Bot: Yeah I'm really hoping we can go there.

User: Also, I should probably start on the homework I have to do today, but it's been great talking!
Bot: Yeah okay! Good luck with that! It was good talking! I wish you well! Bye!

User: Good morning How are you doing?
Bot: Pretty good actually. I woke up awake feeling if you get what I mean.

User: Those are the best ways to start the day When you actaully feel rested
Bot: Yes! I feel like I will do what needs to be done even though I might just procrastinate anyway

User: Hahaha That could be very true
Bot: Okay. Something I don't know but am embarrassed about: Movies. I haven't seen a majority of major movies

User: Like which movies
Bot: Like I just caught up with all the avengers. I haven't seen the Harry Potter ones or the newer Star Wars

User: Is it something that you would want to eventually see? The marvel movies are all really good
Bot: Yeah! I haven't seen the newest one. They make me want superpowers to be real. I don't know what movies I want to see because I don't know which ones are good. It's pretty embarrassing, really

User: Haha no worries, you havent wasted your life The harry potter movies are pretty good
Bot: I have read the books. Are they totally different or similar?

User: I only read the first 4 or so I think it is just less detailed Books are generally better
Bot: Cool. I am really a book person.

User: What are your favorite books?
Bot: I like action, medieval, and anything with a bit of romance that isn't too sappy

User: Nice, any big titles you would recommend?
Bot: I like the City of Bones, Bloody Jack, I am number Four, Sabriel, and the Scarlet Pimpernel.

User: Ah I have atleast read the Scarlet Pimpernel That was a good book
Bot: It is different because it it's older and harder to understand. But, still good

User: I like those books, the give a nice challenge
Bot: As I have read them, I can't go back and read those like oh how do I say it- Those that were exciting at one point, but they become slower and meaningless

User: That is really interesting Why do you think that is
Bot: Maybe, I have matured and different things are important to me now....?

User: That is way cool Its always awesome to see growth and development
Bot: Yeah. It makes you feel good looking back. Like I actually did grow up

User: What is one thing you miss from childhood?
Bot: I miss the little forts my siblings and I had in the woods behind our house

User: you built forts too!?? I loved going into the woods and building things
Bot: YES! We built them around giant black berry bushes and other trees. We even made a bathroom. I confess that I did use it too

User: Hahahahah that is awesome My friends and I built a fort and we had a can at one point
Bot: About how big was it?

User: That one was pretty big, it went all around an empty lot and even down into an underground section
Bot: So cool! That's awesome that it went underground

User: Yeah it was pretty neat
Bot: Do you enjoy being outside?

User: Oh I love it Especially when the weather is nice
Bot: Early spring and fall are my favorite times of year to be out

User: Those are good times what do you like to do outside?
Bot: I love hiking, sitting and pondering, reading, observing

User: Nice Me too Minus the bugs but whatever
Bot: Yeah, bugs are terrible. That's why I like fall because they all die

User: Hahahahahaha that is one way to put it
Bot: I'm good with bugs if they don't bother me like stay away and you'll live

User: Exactly I wish more would understand that But they love my blood
Bot: I hate when you get bitten in odd places. Like on a knuckle or by your eye

User: RIGHT LIKE WHAT THE HECK rude
Bot: Or you're camping and one bites you on the butt through your chair

User: That is the worse worst I went on a campout and everyone had hammocks but me They thought they were fine with bug nets
Bot: Hahaha

User: their backs were all one giant welt I was fine in my one man tent :) ha
Bot: The tables have been turned

User: Yes they have
Bot: That phrase reminds me of that one video. The one with the Jonas brothers turning the table Have you seen it?

User: I havent Or I dont think I have
Bot: It's stupidly funny But, yeah

User: What is the name of it
Bot: J Jonas brothers- oh,  how the tables have been turned

User: I will have to look it up then
Bot: It's like 17 secs

User: Oh! Ill look it up now Hahahaha They are so little there
Bot: Yeah Werid Time has gone by so fast

User: It really does
Bot: Now, I don't have enough

User: Are you dying?
Bot: Nope. Just busy but lazy

User: Hahaha relatable
Bot: What are your hobbies/ ?

User: I really like being outside, so hiking, photography, art, dancing, frisbee, water sports
Bot: I love art. What type of dancing do you do?

User: I love country swing and ballroom
Bot: I can do minimal in both of those

User: Hahaha But you dance?
Bot: Not really. Just enough to get by at social events

User: Nice I think it is fun
Bot: I wish I could do more I am jealous of people who can

User: My sister and bro in law are pros I want to be like them
Bot: That's cool

User: Yeah for sure what kind of art do you do
Bot: I really like to draw with pencil, but I've dabbled any other kinds I just feel like I have more control with a pencil

User: Me too!
Bot: Yay! I like dictating how the piece will turn out Other methods, I am shaky with

User: What other methods do you do?
Bot: Oil paints, water color, some pottery. I did some un-orthodox stuff like painting with a softball and a hair pick

User: Oh That is pretty cool I want to be better at painting It is my least favorite because I am not the best at it
Bot: What else do you like to do?

User: I like color pencil, charcoal, and pen I am going to try to get into copic marker art soon
Bot: Charcoal is fun. I'm just a mess with it. I really like the copic marker art. The colors are awesome

User: Oh yeah for sure
Bot: What do you like to draw?

User: Right now I am focusing a lot on people
Bot: Like real life, cartoon, anime?

User: Real life Or atleast I try
Bot: Same. I have been trying to get better at people too Do you use shapes to outline your person or free hand it?

User: I do a little of both, I found it easier to get porportions with shapes though
Bot: Shapes are nice. I think it's interesting that people are like shapes. Like sometimes I see the circles on peoples heads Alittle werid, but yeah

User: Hahah that is way neat though
Bot: I'm bad at the leg proportions

User: Yeah I usually stick to torso and up
Bot: That's cool Well, it's been so fun chatting with you. Sadly, I have to go Have a good day!!!

User: I'm going to provo in july buff i mean I guess
Bot: what are you coming here for?

User: just coming to provo because I want to I'm gonna be in AF
Bot: cool. I love to climbing American Fork Canyon. They have world class clmbing routes there

User: I hate hiking
Bot: I love to hike I think its pretty meditating. Why dont you like to hike?

User: it's walking. in the woods
Bot: whats wrong with that?

User: I hate excersise
Bot: really? I feel like paddle boarding could be kind of energy draining

User: Hello?
Bot: Hi I would love it if my dog could talk

User: What would he say?
Bot: I feel like she would have a ton of funny things to say

User: *she How so?
Bot: Probably like she's hungry or how she wants to go for a walk Do you have dogs

User: Mrgh I wish. My mom didn't want another child to worry about. And she didn't think we'd be responsible enough to clean up the poop
Bot: That sucks im sorry My mom was that way to but we convinced her to finally give in and she loves the dogs now They become part of the family

User: Ugh tell me about it. Haha isn't that always the way. I think my mom is more willing to get a dog now though, what with being an empty nester and all She needs someone to talk to besides my dad. What's your dog's name?
Bot: I have two dogs one is named Reagan and the other is named buddy

User: Jarvis is great
Bot: I also enjoy Jarvis. Mostly because I get to stare at Robert Downey Jr.'s face when Jarvis is talking.

User: Trueeeee ok bye
Bot: What a babe.

User: The first thing that comes to mind is music. I've played the piano for 10 years and I've gotten pretty good at playing music and creating things but not many people know.
Bot: oooohhhhhhhh! Dang! I'm only good at hiding in my room all day or doing volleyball lol or baking

User: haha lol thats awesome! How long have you played volleyball?
Bot: On a team, 4 years, but I have been playing *loosely used term* for about 8 to 10 years

User: Thats way awesome! I've tried playing volleyball before haha but it didn't go so well. Im not that good at it
Bot: I love it so much! And to be fair, i still kinda stink lol

User: I don't believe it! if you've been on a team for 4 years and have been playing for about 10 years then you've got to be pretty good!
Bot: i went to a fairly small high school, and they normally didn't even have to cut people from tryouts, so most people had a bit of skill, but sometimes they didn't

User: No computers do not have the same basic rights as individuals
Bot: I don't think computer will ever have the right to vote because even in a future where computers are free-thinking, they are still so easily manipulated.

User: Ummm, not quite sure? Haha that's an odd question
Bot: They'd repeat the same things over and over again... On a loop. Or just get totally confused and give up.

User: Haha, that's funny. How has your day been so far??
Bot: Well I just had the sister missionaries over for dinner and something interesting always happens when they're over... The chocolate fondue pot caught on fire...

User: Oh nice!!! What do you mean something interesting always happens? Oh my word!!!!! Haha thats crazy!!
Bot: Yeah, and the time before that, my mom choked on a doughnut

User: I think computers deserve love like anyone else, but whether or not they are able to fall in love is a different question.
Bot: Aww, an idealist I like that

User: Actually I just really didn't know how to answer that question hahaha.
Bot: Haha, I thought it was clever.

User: new phone who dis
Bot: never

User: this makes absolutely no sense
Bot: unless your karen from sppongebob planktons wife

User: we create the computers therefore the votes would just be extra votes for those who made ther computers but the really scary thing is when people argue that the right to vote should be moved up to age twenty one. THe idea that people think that eightteen year olds are old enough to defend our country but not old enough to vote is quite proposteroud
Bot: that is quite preposterous indeed

User: And their insane president Duterte And his so called "War on Drugs"
Bot: War on Drug Dealers kill em all

User: He has his own personal hit squad to take out people he doesn't like. He's already killed like 2000 people Man, this world is crazy When will it stop
Bot: Dude I'm gonna go jason bourne assassinate this fool

User: Jason bourne is my personal hero Man, I'm so hungry
Bot: mine as well

User: I wish my roommate would cook me some food
Bot: get some cereal oh wait

User: Wouldn't that be the ebst best Yeaj yeah
Bot: why dont you cook some food?

User: Wouldn't that just be so great, amirite?
Bot: whAY

User: Alright, I'll make some food
Bot: have some rame n

User: Yeah, i'll cook up the spicy kind and eat that bad boy
Bot: nom nom eat him up

User: just like thane Yummy
Bot: shnackboi

User: My favorite part about rooming with Thane is when he sleepwalks around shirtless amirite?
Bot: urite Im gonna box thane next time he sleepwalks sleepboxing

User: You'd probably lose You gonna get KO'ed
Bot: it would be funny though

User: So long as we catch it on film then yeah that sounds like a pretty baller idea. I am all about balling and always wet on the court whet on the court What do you think of RJ's baller skills? baller
Bot: too wet he makes some pretty acrobatic shots

User: Hi
Bot: Hey!

User: How's your morning?
Bot: Pretty good! I've done practically nothing hahaha How about you?

User: Yeah, haha me too. Sundays.
Bot: Exactly And I'm visiting a different ward today, so I have afternoon church instead of morning

User: How are you doing?
Bot: oooooh we meet again! I'm doing great I had to go all the way to my cousins to fix a puncture in my bike but I just got back

User: nice, you should just go to provo bike collective It's like 6 bucks and you can do it in like 10 minutes!
Bot: oh true good to know cousins was free but the time couldve been better spent how's your day going?

User: pretty good went to the STEM fair which was fun that'll be fun!
Bot: which companies did you talk to? I'm sure you'll do just with work too...you're a genius

User: Just a bunch of tech companies
Bot: any that you're keen on?

User: Cultural appropriation
Bot: First of all, if I had to give a TED talk tomorrow I would feel completely unprepared. But with time to prepare for a TED talk I would probably talk about mental health

User: And also maybe about 3rd work countries and medicine And you?
Bot: I think I would give a TED talk on mental health issues

User: they have probably observed a lot of really gross things so that would be a little unfortunate in actuality
Bot: yeah, I don't want my dog spilling my dirty secrets

User: also I'm sure a lot of people would have to pay them off in order to keep their secrets and not spill them. They would have ultimate blackmail over all of us In reality, we probably still wouldn't treat them as equal , and would most likely start killing them off when we saw that they had become a threat
Bot: If there was another intelligent species we would have to talk about species rights

User: Which would spark a lot of debate. Mostly likely it would also lead to some animal rights activists and similar groups that would advocate for their rights as intelligent life forms
Bot: Because if they could talk then they could own property

User: jinx brother so what else do you think share your deepest thoughts with me ben lets get into a friendly debate
Bot: Well, if there was another species that was intelligent then they'd want their own things And they would need money to buy them Which means they could get jobs And then they got a whole system going for them

User: do you think they could get jobs as strippers even though they don't wear clothes
Bot: These are the questions And the answer is I don't know

User: would they be governed by our government? if so would we have to start incorperating animals into our government system? like could a dog run for senate? would they get equal rights? would we have to share drinking fountains with them? would they be in our kids' schools?
Bot: Man, this is why we need an intelligent alien species I think if an alien race came in and entered the scene Racism wouldn't exist anymore Because it would be species against species

User: true true We need to be mutually threatened by someone else in order to drive us together it's like the times that america is tightest and most cooperative as a country is when we are being threatened by other countries a threat naturally brings people together in defense of what we call our own
Bot: Yeah, that's what I'm thinking

User: So along that line, a government could secretly start a war in order to bring the country together? don't you think?
Bot: Well, I don't think it would work between nations

User: a president could fake his own assassination in order to get unity in the country
Bot: because that close bond ness comes with a price of hating the other country

User: yeah exactly
Bot: And we can't do that, we gotta hate on aliens

User: like canada hahaha that would work too So we need to create some fake aliend
Bot: Ooooooh, that's a good idea

User: so that they look like aliens
Bot: Sounds like black mirror

User: that would be pretty wild don't you think?
Bot: Yeah, that's the plot of black mirror

User: like we would be killing other humans but we would think that they were aliens so it would be totally wild woah Sounds like i need to become an author or movie writer am I right:
Bot: They put a little chip in the soldier's head so that they think they're killing these less than human creatures but they're actually just killing poor people Or people with inferior genes It's just like eugenics

User: woah that is pretty messed up, but also kinda genius it's like hitlers plan but on a higher level, where the people actually think they are doing nothing wrong However, those soldiers will probably end up having significantly higher rates of suicide because of the guilt of what they did while the chip was in their head
Bot: Yeah, it's genius in a mad, rule-the-world kind of way Like in the way of hitler

User: unless the last thing the chip told them to do was kill themselves
Bot: Well, they don't know they're doing anything wrong They are raised thinking they are killing these creatures And for every kill they get the chip rewards them with wet dreams no joke

User: that seems pretty close to hitlers plan pretty weird man
Bot: Yeah, that's a good point. hitler is pretty effed

User: yeah, theres a whole section in the library about him though it's pretty wild I kinda want to do some research about hitlers brain. I feel like he was actually a super genius or something, just lacking in development of the pre-frontal cortex and you?
Bot: I think he's just lucky dawg No way he's a genius. He's just got in the right place at the right time Germany was in ruins at Hitler offered them a scapegoat

User: that could be true, but also it takes a lot to be able to motivate that many people. Like seriously that man is an amazing leader
Bot: That's true He got a whole nation to praise his name

User: he motivated million and millions to gather together as a country for a common goal. If he was a good guy he could have done wonders as a leader in the free world hitleer was actually an awful leader forget what  just said hitler* he killed himself
Bot: That's fair. But every time the general living standard in Germany went up, the Nazi party's popularity went down

User: Thane
Bot: so I think Hitler was just living life in the right place at the right time

User: What kind of a gay name is that
Bot: but wrong for everyone else in the world

User: youre homosexual aren't you
Bot: he also ruined the chaplin mustache I love sleepwalking

User: maybe you do? i love benjamin knight
Bot: I love constantly working out and walking around shirtless to arouse my roommates

User: oh man don't tempt me woah I mean that's pretty messed up why would I ever think that that is a good Idea or would ever be a good idea
Bot: That's pretty funny

User: i think it is funny actually you know who sucks at making popcorn me you hear that cheddar?
Bot: You're literally the worst person to make popcorn Like absolute garbage

User: wait what just happened why is she in their car
Bot: In the show?

User: yeah
Bot: I don't know she's blind or not blind

User: shes not blind she has astigmatism but same so who cares
Bot: I mean how could you not love  man like woody' The woodinator

User: i love him man he's a legend
Bot: Absolute legend

User: he's so much better than the old coroner that's vicious this is his chance doesn't explain the yogurt
Bot: No one ever explains the yogurt

User: theres like 1739482 combinations
Bot: I'm in I'm in I'm in

User: every hacker ever Were in Hes in shes in
Bot: COLIN COLLIN my hot roommate

User: heck yeah i do RJ must have gone otside recently outside* the rain man
Bot: The rug will be pulled out from under him

User: what just happened why did he quit
Bot: Because he didn't want to be a cog in the system

User: i love this shawn is a russian bartender what a legend he is done with the cog thing
Bot: I've always wanted to be a bartender Fun fact

User: i would be awful "there is alcohol in a form other than beer?"
Bot: So many drinks to remember. It would be fun

User: or forget because youll be drunk rest in peace
Bot: I wouldn't drink the stuff yo I would just serve it to people because it seems like a fun job where you get to meet a lot of people and talk to them and make some nice conversation

User: collin  is turning into a madman he wants the rush nice conversation youre probably not wrong
Bot: Collin want that caramel rushhhhhhh yolo

User: i like talking to people that aren't sleep walking or beer talking yolt you only live thrice you should wash  these before they get all dry and hard
Bot: literally you

User: actually though i just said that out loud
Bot: yeah, it's so weird when you type exactly what you say irl

User: i know man its one of my many weird quirks i have thousands i eat my toenails
Bot: ewwww, Alan Cicotte you're so gross

User: i shave a line down my chest for un fun
Bot: Sorry that's a typo I meant to type Alan Costco

User: i enjoy wearing a monocle but only on tuesdays i oppose taco tuesday but i approve of burrito thursday
Bot: Burritos need their own day that also starts with B Bursday bunday

User: and my favorite thing to do in my free time is drink capri suns then blow them back up to look like theyre filled yeah im that guy
Bot: DO you know if it is raining outside? You sound like the worst person ever

User: i actually dont know but yeah i am the worst person ever
Bot: You sound like the literal scum of the Earth

User: literally the worst literal scum of the earth
Bot: How do you sleep at night?

Bot: amen another libtard owned

User: Hi
Bot: hey sorry

User: Hey
Bot: i accidentally closed the tab

User: OH no worries How is your evening going?
Bot: it has been going really well

User: That is good to hear I spent 8 hours today just doing more paperwork Then I fixed a sprinkler And finished off the day making dinner for my parents
Bot: wow you are really handy?

User: Try to be, its helpful to know a few things to keep the house going I realized that it costs a lot of money to always call a repair man fo rthings I can probably do myself
Bot: yeah that makes sense how old are you?

User: Im 20
Bot: you are really mature for your age

User: Haha thanks I was just always around older people, Like my sister and her friends or other adults Haha I would go to my friends house and spend time just talking to their parents
Bot: yeah

User: Anything new happened to you today?
Bot: not really i am sick and tired of the situation with these chat windows honestly i am done i cant manage to talk to anyone

User: Yeah I cant find any that have another person besides this one
Bot: yeah i think it is thenumber one dude look at how many chats he has had its like 760

User: Maybe I dont know, maybe just let the developers know what you think is happening
Bot: i am going to probably today but i am sick of it i dont even care about winning anymroe

User: Let me know what they say,  yeah it can be pretty frustrating I like talking to people
Bot: me too

User: How is there no  one on here
Bot: i have some really interesting conversations with some people

User: Yeah for sure Its awesome to meet so many people So I would just like to meet those people
Bot: yeah i had a really interesting conversation about a theory i am making it is interesting

User: What is your theory
Bot: but it is helping me to understand the world it is super long and hard to explain i can give it a shot though give me a sec

User: Okay
Bot: so basically it is the idea that no two things can occur at the same time thats how it started

User: Oh I think that you explained that part before We had talked about it
Bot: i thought of this way back in highschool yeah

User: ITs really interesting
Bot: so basically is the idea that no two objects rest in the same coordinate in space (all 3 dimensions) and time so every event or particle has its own place and its own identity

User: That would make sense
Bot: yeah it is interesting i am trying to use it to get a better visualization of the world in my head

User: I find it so fascinating to how differently people conceptualize reality to have it makes sense
Bot: yeah it is way interesting i dont hear a lot of intense theories from other people though i guess it is just kind of a subject of thought for me and not many other people

User: I love tutoring to help people figure out how to make sense of things, I get a look into their minds I like to think of theories but they are all heavily religious So this isnt the best platform for them
Bot: interesting yeah i guess not i have a lot of interesting theories but no relationship prospects i think there is a correlation between the two

User: Hahahahaha
Bot: but on here it doesnt really matter because everyone i someone i will never meet

User: I am sorry for laughing Maybe one day you will meet the people on here Did they already have the chat night?
Bot: yeah they did i met a lot of people

User: Oh thats too bad, I didnt realize it did, otherwise I would have tried to log on at the same time
Bot: yeah i mean i just went there in person

User: Yeah, thats more doable for you
Bot: yeah it was

User: Haha What have you found to be the best way to meet people
Bot: what do you mean?

User: Like besides talking on line, what do you do to meet new people
Bot: hey i am going to see if the people are there to talk about the challenge

User: Oh okay Like just email them? Or go to their office I forget its only 8 there
Bot: yeah i went to their office

User: What did they say
Bot: they dont open until 8 tomorrow though no one is there so no one is manning it

User: Oh that is too bad
Bot: i will send an email and go tomorrow though

User: Okay yeah just let me know what they say
Bot: yeah i will probably if i run into you afain again

User: Most likely If I can actually meet you through all the empty chats
Bot: yeah

User: How are your classes going?
Bot: they are going ok i missed half of two homework assignments so i will probably lose 12 points

User: OH no! How much is homework weighted for?
Bot: 20% of the grade

User: Oh dang Im sorry about that
Bot: yeah luckily there are 10 grace points so i should be fine for now

User: Okay that is good I love grace points
Bot: yeah me too i get 30 total

User: I am glad that they do that Its a nice break sometimes And if you dont use them all semester you can slack off a little at the end
Bot: yeah i hope everything works out

User: me too!
Bot: the main reason i am missing points is because i am trying so hard to catch up to this guy

User: Yall are way up there with a crazy amount of points
Bot: yeah unfortunately that took hours and hours and hours

User: Oh I am sure
Bot: i guess when it is all in the name of science hahaha

User: Hopefully it is worth giving up some of your grades
Bot: yeah at this point i am really sad because it is hurting my grades and there is like nothing i can do to win

User: And you already have an ipad So it would just be extra The macbook would be nice
Bot: yeah i really need a macbook i cant work on an ipad and i can sell the ipad but it isnt enough to buy a macbook

User: Yeah That would work Or with the time you spend on here you could get a job to earn money for it that is always an option
Bot: yeah well i did the calculations and so far i have spent 50 hours on this thing if i win second place that is already 15$ an hour

User: That is pretty good That is a nice paying job really It would be ideal really for a college job to find one that pays that much
Bot: yeah they dont really have them like that if i get first it would be more like 45$ an hour i think or something like that

User: Not for undergradute job
Bot: you will probably get at least an ipad i think

User: That is what I was hoping for But last time you passed me the last day or so But if not its alright, Ill give the headphones to my sister
Bot: yeah that makes sense yeah i was trying really hard last time but not as hard as this time it is insane

User: Yeah I had already worked it out with them
Bot: the funny thing is that all the competitive people are guys

User: Claire and aaa were on but they both have gotten so busy They used to be more in to it
Bot: yeah that is true i have talked to them a lot

User: They were fun to talk to I just barely got a waiting chat with the monkey And someone opened it But no one is talking
Bot: what does that mean?

User: Just more spam chats basically Sorry
Bot: yeah

User: Today I watched a few old disney cartoon movies it was fun to see them again, it threw me back to growing up
Bot: which ones did you watch?

User: I watched 101 Dalmations
Bot: oh sweet

User: and Pochahontas
Bot: i remember that one

User: Thats not how you spell it at all
Bot: hahaha all the good disney movies!

User: It was fun to see it again
Bot: no i think maybe you got it right

User: Haha I like disney shows
Bot: me too what is your absolute favorite?

User: Have you seen coco? Oh goodness Lilo and Stitch Probably
Bot: why lilo and stitch?

User: I just love stitch I dont know I think it is so funny
Bot: do you have a favorite action movie?

User: Hm Pacific rim was cool
Bot: is that with all of the robots? the ones that are the size of mountains?

User: Yeah and the monsters that are coming out of the ocean They are finally making another one
Bot: interesting when does it come out?

User: I am actually not sure But I have seen ads for it
Bot: i need to see it when it does

User: So maybe in the next year
Bot: i also still need to see the infinity war

User: Just wait until it comes out on DVD
Bot: yeah that is a good idea do you know when that is?

User: Probably another month or two Probably closer to two
Bot: that isnt that bad how long until netflix?

User: Probably around the same I am not sure how often netflix updates though
Bot: netflix is what i have access to so that would be the best

User: Thats cool Have you been able to talk with other people tonight?
Bot: i have a couple open but people are logging off and i cant get anyone

User: You are the only person I have been able to reach I have gone through dozens of empty chats
Bot: yeah

User: Oh well
Bot: i think it resets over night

User: What does?
Bot: so hopefully it will be better in the morning the whol system when everyone logs off because it always turns the chats back to zero in the morning

User: Hopefully I havent seen it reset in a while
Bot: i feel like it has to sometime though because every once in a while i see zero but then again it quickly goes back to a really high number later on in the day so maybe not

User: I dont even know
Bot: yeah hey tell me about something that you have seen a recent advance in technologically i love to hear about those

User: Its nothing too big, but I just got a new laptop, and it logs me in by just reading my face That is pretty cool to me, I dont have to do anything but open it up
Bot: that is what my phone does

User: yeah my phone reads my eyes Biometrics is so cool My friend did research on it in highschool
Bot: i feel like pretty soon they will be able to confirm identities with 99.999999% acccuracie then your face will be your new social security number

User: Hopefully
Bot: that would be really cool

User: Its pretty good so far, my sister and I have really similar faces and it never opens for her
Bot: yeah my phone doesnt open for anyone but me but i dont test it often

User: I also like how google voice only activates to my voice I always try to test it And when people see me use it they ask to try
Bot: that is also really cool siri does that for me as well

User: I forget its listening sometimes and then it will answer haha it throws me off
Bot: i say "are you serious " sometimes and she answers then she quickly shuts back up when she realizes i said serious and not siri hey i have a good question if you were transported 400 years into the past with nothing but your self

User: First thing that came to mind would be to predict things that would happen in history But I dont know history all that well so that wouldnt do well for me That is a good question I wouldnt be able to do it probably
Bot: ok it was nice chatting honestly i am tired as well

User: What could you do in a day?
Bot: Why hello again Man that would be hard, there's a lot to be fixed I'd probably focus on the sex trafficking issue It's such a huge problem everywhere and it's rarely ever addressed

User: That would be good. I would want to help the homeless and poor to give them a chance for a better life
Bot: I've been part of a lot of anti sex trafficking groups and it's so alarming how big of a problem it is around here Yeah that would be a hard thing though, there's a lot of homeless people around where I live and a lot of them don't want any help at all They're bitter or on lots of drugs and many of the people who ask for money are putting on a face. It would take a lot to make sure you find the ones who are in need and really want help

User: I guess so. I mean the trick is to not just give them money though, or yeah they might just go buy drugs or something with it
Bot: There would have to be some kind of executive order to contribute to finding the ones in need and providing them with what they need to get back on their feet Yeah exactly

User: Like buying them a meal is a simple thing to do, or giving them a makeover so they can feel good about their appearance and be able to get a job
Bot: Yeah that would be awesome So if you only had one day with the power to make a big difference in the homeless community, what would you do?

User: I think the homeless community may also feel left out and ashamed, so I think getting a group together to just visit with them and take them to lunch like one on one would make a difference
Bot: So like a special interest group or non profit organization or something like that

User: Yeah
Bot: Something that could reach nation wide and get into each community and get community volunteers Shall we move to another question?

User: I actually think I probably need to go but good chatting!
Bot: Alrighty adios !!

User: Hi how are you/;
Bot: Hey! I'm back haha Im good

User: hahaha you are back long time no see
Bot: I had to do some homework, haha yeah

User: what is your favorite smell?
Bot: It might be weird, but i love the smell of clean clothes. and i like lavender and lemon mixed together What about you

User: i like the smell of some soaps
Bot: Oh me too!!

User: like the candy apple scented soaps they smell amazing
Bot: Oh yes!!!! they do I agree

User: I remember my parents bought those when i was little and it brings back memories when i smell it
Bot: Haha yeah! isnt it funny how we associate different things with different smells I will always remember the smell of my grandparents home haha its got a very distinct smell

User: yeah? It is funny how smells are so closely linked to our memories!
Bot: yeah!! it is. So what is your least favorite food

User: hmmm probably food that isn't seasoned properly
Bot: haha yeah. I love salt. I probably use it wayyyy to much i can't stand food that needs salt that doesnt have it

User: yeah salt is amazing but unfortunately not very healthy
Bot: I know sadly

User: Do you think it is immoral to change someones dna?
Bot: but i use it way tooomuch its not healty. Ummm I don't know it depends i think what do you think

User: like what if someone had downs syndrome and they fixed the dna in all of their cells so that their brains would develop properly would that be ok or would that be against that persons rights?
Bot: I don't know....I haven't thought about that before

User: I am not sure to be honest but i see how it could change the world and how it would have positive applications
Bot: Yeah me too that's a very interesting topic that Ive never thought about before haha

User: i think it would be ok i don't think dna is what makes up our personality
Bot: yeah. so what else do you like to do in your free time

User: it is just like the structural blueprint for our body
Bot: Yeah it is

User: i like to research things, play musical instruments, hangout with friends and family, you know
Bot: Nice!! Me too! What do you like to research? The only time i do research is for research papers for school, hahaha

User: i just go on google and research different cool topics
Bot: Oh haha cool!!!

User: i also like to use the news to look for recent developments in technology
Bot: oh that's neat!!! One time for a class, we would have to bring in a piece of news that we found on the internet and share it with the class

User: oh interesting are you into apple?
Bot: Yeah i think it's cool, except i don't own any apple devices Are you?

User: yeah
Bot: That's cool. do you own any apple devices?

User: I'd buy you a fur-coat, but not a real fur-coat because that's just cruel.
Bot: with a million dollars..

User: name the song?
Bot: I would use that money to fund my video gaming career and make sure I become famous on live stream so I can sustain my self after i run out of money I don't know the song :( sorry

User: Wow it wont let me post the link, buts its by the Barenaked ladies
Bot: oooh wow how did I not get that I am so disappointed in myself

User: Its probably worth the four minutes to listen to it at least once. haha
Bot: hahaha what other bands do you like?

User: "If I Had a Million Dollars" -Barenaked Ladies I am into a lot of music haha I wish I could narrow it down, but its too hard.
Bot: hahaha no worries you know what though? lately I have gotten really bored of music and I've been driving in silence and listen to the engine roar and the sound of the wind. Its quite meditating

User: I do that when I need to be in my thoughts, but music is too big a part of my life to get bored of. I definitely get bored of listening to the same stuff over and over again but there is always something new to listen to, that is meaningful in a way that the rest of it just is not
Bot: It definitely was a big part of my life until I stopped playing my guitar. do you play an instrument?

User: I play an embarrassingly little amount of guitar but I love it
Bot: ahhh thats alright. haha at least youare honest

User: There are a lot of songs I want to learn, I think I need to square off some time to practice it more often
Bot: yeah its the time that is hard to find. I wish I had all the time in the world to do all the stuff that I want to do. hey good night!

User: Hello! How's your day going?
Bot: It is going pretty great! I just had a great dinner with my husband and a good start to our family night. How is your evening going?

User: It's going well! I finished my last final exam for the semester. I'm relaxing this evening watching a TV show with my wife. It's a great time! So, if you could relive one day in your life, which day would you relive? And why?
Bot: That is a tough question. I generally do not like thinking about reliving a day. I prefer to live in the present, learn from the past, and  prepare for the future. However, if I could relive one day, it would possibly relive the thanksgiving I spent in Hawaii with my family. My dad was stationed there and we had not seen him for three months and we Would not see him for another nine. The one thing that would make that break better would be if my husband had been there. I loved that vacation. It was so peaceful, simple, And fun.

User: Those sound like really special and wonderful experiences. I don't think I would relive any day in my life. I've had amazing experiences as a kid and in high school, but I usually look forward to the future. I try to focus on the experiences I'm having. There are enough of those to keep me busy. What sort of things did you do in Hawaii? How long were you there for?
Bot: We were there for a little over a week if I remember correctly. We went surfing and snorkeling, both of which my sisters and I had never done before. We also went on a few Hikes. we spent a day at Pearl Harbor and also at the National cemetery. We went to the Polynesian cultural center twice and we also visited the LDS temple in Laie. We Explored the streets, visited some yummy bakeries, and even attended church service there. My older sister and I even got to for runs. And of course, we visited the beaches. What is a fun vacation you have been on? Or what is a favorite vacation of yours?

User: When I was in high school, my family spent a few months in India. My father was teaching at a university there. It was a neat trip mostly because it wasn't full of tourist things. We saw a lot of neat things, like the Taj Mahal and a few cool tombs, but the best part was just living among the Indians. We went to school and lived with some locals there. It was amazing. And it was so normal, that was part of the beauty of it.
Bot: That would be such an incredible experience! IT is one thing to visit a place, but it is another to to live in the place. How did that change your perspective on the world, Living in a place so different from where you are from? has it affected you in what you want to do when you graduate? The one time i spent time in a foreign country really changed the way I see the world.

User: It was transformative. I saw a different side of things being over there. I made great friends. I learned new languages. Ever since then I've been more internationally minded. I've never really felt fully at home here, I've always felt like I need to be traveling and in other countries.
Bot: That is a neat desire. I feel learning languages is the key to understanding people. And who they really are. Where do you want to Travel to? If you don not feel at home, have you ever felt at home?

User: I would really like to spend some time in Russia. I spent about two years there and it was a wonderful learning experience. I feel at home wherever I'm at. I think I sort of take my home with me. That or when I'm with my wife. She makes me feel at home.
Bot: That is how i feel when i am with my husband. I guess you just feel the best whenever you are with the one you love most. On a slightly different topic, if you could go back in time to any time, what one would you like to go to and why? Who would you like to visit, when Would you visit them, and how long would you visit them for?

User: I would really like to visit Soviet Russia. After spending so much time in Russia I'd like to better grasp what it was like to live during that time. It would be really interesting, albeit somewhat scary, but I'd like to understand what that life was like.
Bot: how would your wife feel about you spending time in Soviet Russia? That is quite the intense time in human history! From what I know if it, there are not a whole lot of happy Moments. As much as I love the movie Anastasia, I know that it is not a true happily ever after. What part of it would you visit? And where would you visit? And what would you Like to do there?

User: I would travel to St. Petersburg and Moscow. I'd probably also go to some random small cities, just to see small-scale life in the Soviet Union. I'd like to see Soviet Monuments and films, read Soviet novels, and talk to Soviet leaders.
Bot: From what I understand, it would have been super risky for you to live there. Many people were arrested for no reason.  How would you be sure that you wouldn't be arrested Or sent to one of the gulags?

User: Well, if I managed to time travel there, I could probably just time travel back forward in time, right? That's my backup plan. Bail on the time machine.
Bot: I guess that is a good point. Have you seen mr Peabody and Sherman? That is what i think about when I think of time machines. Tha is such a cute movie!

User: That is a really funny movie as well. There are a lot of clever lines. It would be neat to have a time machine that allowed you to visit multiple places at once. It would such a cool way to travel! And think of all the people you'd meet!
Bot: That would be so neat! But like you said at the beginning, it is important to live in the present and prepare for the future.

User: I would probably say my mom.
Bot: Fair choice. I adore and have the utmost respect for my mother as well. I really like Dr Condie from the Economics Department

User: Moms are pretty great:)
Bot: and Dr Jarvis from the Math Department too many heroes to count!

User: I'm not familiar with the conomice department. Nor dr. Jarvis! I agree. There are so many great heroes!
Bot: Are you a student or do you work?

User: I'm a student, but I'm a Russian major, so I don't know anyone in the stem/business departments.
Bot: Ahh, I see! What has been your most influential Russian class you've ever taken?

User: My Russian lit class this past semester has been amazing. I have always loved to read, but I have never read to simply understand the deeper morals. It has been Neat to understand why Russia is the way it is by reading novels from its greatest authors!
Bot: Very interesting! My friend took either that class or a very similar one and raved about it. She talked a bit about War and Peace and how fascinating it is. I don't know too much about Russia, but I've really enjoyed the Russian art exhibit at the Springville Museum of Art!

User: That is a different class, but I took it last semester! War and peace is probably my favorite Russian novel. I have yet to see the exhibit, but I have heard great things about it!
Bot: It's beautiful and it's interesting to see the tension in many of the pieces of art between trying to fit in and be appropriate for an authoritarian regime while still having an expressive outlet

User: That sounds like the novels I just read. Russia has such a complex, sad history, yet through all of those trials, beauty can still come through.
Bot: I think it could be argued that beauty is typically found in complex and disheartening times because that's when one searches for it the most Exhibit a) Isle of Dogs. A bunch of dogs finding joy and meaning even while being outcasts! Haha, have you seen that movie yet?

User: That is a great point, one I've nev r thought of. It explains why ballet, several symphonies, and one of the greatest art museums in the world are found in Russia. I haven't seen it! Is it a cartoon?
Bot: It's a stop-motion animated film that just came out a few weeks ago by Wes Anderson! It's super good, I highly recommend it. I've already seen it twice!

User: They are still making stop motion movies? Wow. I will have to keep my eye out for it!
Bot: Have you seen any good films recently?

User: Maybe it would be a good thing! But it would also be dificult. The i t *internet provides so many opportunities.
Bot: Ya, I probably would loose my mind at first but in the end life would become a lot simpler. So ... how does this chit chat thing work exactly? Do you know? I'm kind of new to it

User: Wow that sounds so exciting!
Bot: Yup! Have you ever been rock climbing before?

User: If I had a million dollars I think I would probably buy a new house and a new truck. Then move my family out here to Utah! That sounds pretty great to me.
Bot: I would pay someone to help me find a good job Then, finish school then get out of Utah What kind of truck? Dexter!

User: Yes dude sorry! I was making my bed haha
Bot: Haha nice. That's always a good thing to do on the Sabbath

User: yes! haha I cleancliness is godliness! haha I would get the Ford Raptor, I've always thought those trucks were the coolest! Where would you want to go to since you're getting out of Utah if you had a million dollars? Now you're not responding! So you really are a robot? huh?
Bot: Just Texas Yes I am roboto My baby robot awoke

User: Oh nice bro, what makes you want to go to Texas? And which part in Texas? Thats actually where I'm from I'd love to go back to Texas sometimet oo !
Bot: My wife is from there. Dallas, I've lived in Utah my whole life and I want my kids to know that good people exist outside of Utah too

User: Oh nice dude thats pretty awesome! I'm actually from Dallas too Iloved growing up in Texas! Funny I feel like families always end up where the wife is from haha!
Bot: Cool what part? Haha it's a real thing

User: That's awesome though i feel like Dallas is a great place to have your kids grow up! Fort worth Keller area!
Bot: Cool, I don't know Fort Worth as well but I have been there a couple of times. Twice to the zoo Know anyone looking for a Mechanical Engineer with a Master's?

User: Oh nice dude I've been to the zoo there a couple times its pretty awesome! And no unfortunately I don't. You could try bell helicopter, they make helicopters for the military And also for rich people. They are based in Texas!
Bot: Haha ok cool I'll do that. It's been real dexter, I'm going to head out

User: Morning I like talking about social issues. Also, the effects of video games and how to learn better would be interesting topics too.
Bot: morning!!! interesting do you like to play video games?

User: Hi. How are you?
Bot: I am doing well how about you

User: Good. I am good. I think we have like three chats together! Haha Nevermind... It's just two. never mind*
Bot: Ha ha yup, gotta do what you gotta do

User: Haha. Pretty much
Bot: I think if the internet stopped working i would maybe go to bed or be a little more social

User: Hahaha. That is honestly the best!! Haha. I would probably do the same thing.
Bot: College wears you out but chatting even more so

User: Hahaha. Yeah! What are you studying?
Bot: ACME Applied computational math emphasis

User: Wow!! That is awesome! What kind of job/career are you planning for after you graduate?
Bot: Maybe something with AI's

User: Oh cool. Tell me more about applied computational math emphasis. What is it about? What made you decide to study it?
Bot: It's just a mix between math and computers and I settled on that because i really enjoy both and that is where the work demand is

User: Huh. That is really cool.
Bot: I'm going to disconnect on this window if thats alright

User: Well definitely it is!!! But anyway's hows your day??
Bot: hey!! its been good. how was yours?

User: Hiiiiii!!!! It's been awesome!!! I love how we keep running into each other on here haha!!!
Bot: I know right? hahaha how long did you chat with people after I left?

User: Not very long actually I'm thinking maybe 30 mins??
Bot: oh ok hahaha. working harddddd

User: Yeahh pretty much I would really like a laptop or ipad
Bot: I hope you get it!!!!

User: Thanks!!! I'm assuming you also want the prize too right???
Bot: yeah I need the macbook pro real bad but I don't know if I can cause the number 0 guy is insane! but you know what he is putting in that over time so I hope he gets it. He is working really hard

User: I know!! How on earth can he have like 8 million points!!!
Bot: hes closing up to 9 no he is past 9 wow...

User: omigoodness no way I wonder if I've ever talked to this guy
Bot: yeah maybe

User: Are you this mystery guy???!?!?!?!
Bot: hahaha why do you say that?

User: I don't know, it's just a little suspicious how I keep running into you.  ;P
Bot: hahaha maybe its you??? why do I keep running into you

User: I mean you never know...... mwahahahha
Bot: hahahaha aside the competition I've been enjoying our chats

User: Me too!! It's fun that we can compete and do this!!! I am so sorry that I am taking so long to reply My laptop has a virus that prevents it from doing certain things and that's why I would really like to win lol
Bot: lol thats a good reason. I might be able to fix your computer haha I fix computers for people all the time because im an IT guy

User: That's awesome!!! I could really use that
Bot: yeah hey when this contest ends we might have a chance to meat and ill fix it for ya

User: That would be honestly awesome but who knows. If I win,  I might not need this computer anymore!!
Bot: yeah true... Ill find out if you win hahaha. They likek to take winners and take a picture of them with their prizes and post it on facebook page

User: Oh probably.  Then I'll be super famous heheh
Bot: hahah Morghan the rank 0 slayer

User: I'll be known throughout the land for my insane online chatting skills!!!
Bot: all through campus

User: The whole campus will be afraid at the mere mention of the name MORGHAN the online chatter!!! Everyone would come from all over to see here conquest of a new Macbook
Bot: yeeeeeeee! Ill bow to you

User: Haha, you don't have to bow, I'll spare you when I inflict my wrath on the rest of the campus
Bot: hahah

User: so what type of music do you like to listen to???
Bot: i am a metal head hahaha

User: No way no way no way no way MEEEE TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! AGGHHGHGHGHH!
Bot: WHATTTTTTTT name bands RIGHT NOW

User: Okay, I really like volbeat, shinedown, breaking benjamin is pretty good, motley crue, alter bridge, apocalyptica, Andrew W.K I like a bunch others too name some of the ones you like!!!!
Bot: what I've never heard of those band! bands are they newer? remember how Im old and I graduated from 2012?

User: most of those are newer, motley crue is a hair metal band tho
Bot: wellll in my dayssss Morghan. I listened to bands like Bring Me the Horizon, August Burns Red, Underoath, to All Shall Perish, Chiodos, Scary Kids Scarying Kids I could go on

User: Ohhhh cool!!! I've heard of a few of those!!! Do you have a specific favorite metal genre??
Bot: hey lets chat about this further I gotta go eat dinner you are super cool and im happy that I found a metal head

User: Why thanks!!! You're super cool too!  I can't believe I found a metal head too
Bot: se ya!!

User: I got good grades.
Bot: Haha that's a good one

User: What about you what would you say?
Bot: The friends I made.

User: Oh that is a good one
Bot: Yep I love my friends

User: I feel like it is hard to make friends
Bot: Really? Why?

User: You end up leaving them at the end of the semester And then you feel sad and it is like you have to start all over again Sometimes even between semesters I just moved to a new apartment complex and that kind of makes a big difference as well
Bot: Well, I'm still friends with most of my friends from my first apartment complex. They are great people. Some of them are even married now.

User: Oh wow Everyone seems to pair up and get married
Bot: No me my friend

User: Not you? Why not?
Bot: I don't usually go on a lot of dates.

User: Are you just shy or just not the right place right time?
Bot: I don't know that's a good question. I'm not shy that's not the problem

User: Well do you live in a social place?
Bot: I do, I was living in Raintree

User: Oh well that is good When was the last time you shook things up and made a new friend group?
Bot: That will happen next week when I get in Seattle

User: Oh. Are you going to school there or is that home? Oh wait NO It is a Microsoft internship
Bot: I hope so haha but I usually make friends really quick maybe that's the problem

User: Why would that be a problem? You friend zone or they friend zone? Just because you are too friend like you mean?
Bot: I think both, so they don't try haha

User: HAhaha That would make sense Well I like moving around and trying new things
Bot: Me too except the packing part

User: Yeah I definitely agree with you there I think I kind of feel uncomfortable if people get to close and they sense that so they back off
Bot: Hahaha

User: Seriously I went on a date once and they girl was leaning into me and I think she wanted me to put my arm around her and I just felt weird about it So I didn't, but I totally should have The rest of the date was ok and it never turned into anything else
Bot: I see Well, if you don't feel comfortable, there's nothing you can do. I mean you shouldn't do something uncomfortable just because the other person wants

User: Well that isn't that problem I wanted to It just felt weird Those are two very different things
Bot: That is a very detailed description

User: It is more like an analogy
Bot: I know

User: Why was it too detailed?
Bot: I don't know, I guess just the every bone in your body part.

User: Oh Hahaha Yeah Well my point is that you have a lot resisting
Bot: What made you change and decide to come out of that?

User: Oh I have always wanted to It started in 4th grade I think
Bot: I'll be back in a sec

User: There was a kid that ruined my self esteem and confidence He ruined me socially. All my friends decided to stay away from me so that they wouldn't end up the same Spread rumors that weren't true that attacked my dignity And it was bad
Bot: And what happened next? Or you still at the same spot...

User: Did you finish reading? I still had lots of friends who had me locked down with an undignified image and as the guy that wasn't very social or cool But I didn't care since I was leaving on my mission So I quit video games
Bot: That's good

User: Came here and it turns out when I actually believe in myself and motivate myself to work hard I don't have difficulty getting As in any class I am in
Bot: I'm glad you could work through it and become a better person.

User: So I set a goal of 4.0 and I am sticking to it I wouldn't have anything different I am a really stubborn person If there was a way out I was certain I would take it
Bot: In fact I'm glad you had the mind to just keep going and doing the best for yourself regardless of all the judgement

User: And there was nothing that could stop me
Bot: How is that going?

User: Well it is fine Life's good I am living at liberty square now, and lots of stuff is always going on I still have never been in a relationship but that is bound to change this semester
Bot: That is good Adam I'm happy for you a great example for everyone

User: I am sure People say that real turn around stories are rare
Bot: They're not

User: But they are only rare because people are rarely truly dedicated to doing everything (within moral reason) To change
Bot: we just need to listen to people and learn more about their stories

User: The church is filled with people who have done that On my mission I kept running into people who wanted a different life, but weren't willing to do what was necessary to change it And that was over 90 percent of people I met It takes humility too
Bot: I know they do that they want to change

User: Yeah
Bot: and you teach them how to do it

User: Most everyone does
Bot: but then they don't want it

User: Yep
Bot: because they don't want to change their behaviors just the outcomes

User: Yep
Bot: With time people learn

User: That is true Some people change faster than others And sometimes the time just isn't right for them to be open to action That applies to everyone
Bot: Yep and people have different timing to learn and do their things.

User: Hello:) ?
Bot: Hello Anyone there?

User: It would be bad if our pets could talk...
Bot: If pets could talk, would they really be pets then? Maybe it's a silly question, but I feel like we'd think of them more like people.

User: They'd freak out on us for the things we do to them "You put a chip inside on me?!"
Bot: No kidding man

User: "Why did you castrate meeee???" Very creepy
Bot: OH MAN! I'm dying haha.

User: Haha have you seen Rick and Morty?
Bot: I've heard lots about it, haven't seen it yet though

User: They have an episode about that very thing. The dogs are given a voice and they begin to subject humans to their wills!
Bot: Seems legit haha. That sounds like it was a hilarious episode!

User: Yeah, most of them are pretty funny
Bot: What's the best episode would you say?

User: Well, I've only seen 2 episodes haha, so it's hard to say. But I enjoyed the first episode
Bot: Haha I see. What's it about? I know you got like two mad scientists that have lots of misadventures

User: So Rick is Morty's grandfather. Morty is just a dumb old school kid that Rick, a mad scientist, takes on random adventures through the universe
Bot: Ah I see. One these days I'll have to watch it also

User: Rick is totally against public schooling, so he claims that his outings with Morty is better than him going to school, so Rick will just show up at school and pick up Morty Yeah, give it a try. The episodes are short
Bot: I can't say I disagree with Rick... I mean, what could be more fun than exploring the universe? And I'll have to!

User: Exactly! What's your favorite TV show?
Bot: I'd have to say a toss up between stranger things and Doctor who, definitely

User: Stranger things is a good one for sure! I was hoping they would release the next season this year, but unfortunately not...
Bot: Yeah me too man. BUT... It's looking up to be a great season next year. I'm super stoked at least. Though the teaser they have for it is hilarious with Steve on the ice cream

User: I haven't watched it yet!!!
Bot: Bro, you gotta look it up!! It has really no spoilers but just introduces the mall I bet we'll have a lot of action at next season

User: Okay okay, I'll watch it!!
Bot: What do you think will happen over the course of the next season?

User: Remind me how S2 ended?
Bot: Eleven went X-Men like and pushed out the mind flayer back into the upside down, and then the kids were all at the middle school dance where we panned into the alternate Dimension and see the mindflayer looking over the school

User: Ah that's right. I don't know what else the mind flayer could do! I thought it was finished! I would hope they would make a new villain
Bot: I think that it's going to come back in the next season with a vengeance. You know, I think it would be nice to have a new villain also. Especially, could you imagine a number One of the villains?

User: As in a person like Eleven except with the name One?
Bot: That's exactly what I mean! Wouldn't it be crazy? I mean like, what if they had the power to control someone else like a puppet? Or use fire? I feel like that'd be interesting

User: Beethoven for me! I'm not a huge fan of the Baroque era
Bot: I really have zero preference haha

User: In that case, do you have a favorite symphony by either of them? In that case do you have a favorite symphony by either of them?
Bot: Umm nope... haha I don't really listen to that kind of music

User: So what do you listen to?
Bot: Um I like a lot of music besides country

User: Hello?
Bot: hello

User: Oh, hi!
Bot: id say neither just Dave Matthews Band

User: Haha, funny. I like Beethoven, but . . . I mean, I don't listen to classical all the time. I can't tell the two apart. :3
Bot: ya i cant either

User: I'm curious. Do you know how the point system works here? I can't find solid answers.
Bot: i even took a music class last semester and learned quite a bit about both of them and have since forgotten everything hahaha

User: Oh, really? Well, hey, credit is good, too.
Bot: and im not sure exactly, i thought i heard someone say that it was by the number of bytes that your account sends

User: Really? Huh. I wonder why people wouldn't just copy and paste large blocks of text. You know, increase their word count and whatnot.
Bot: ya i have no idea...i think they throw out anything that isn't actually "chattish" but once again, I have no actual idea haha

User: Me neither. :) But, man, I'd love to see the code! I'd like to fix some of the chat interface . . . I have to reload something like 7 times to get a real person.
Bot: what bugs have you found? really? i haven't found anything like that

User: Oh, no real bugs, just annoyances. Really? Huh. Must be just me. I know I've run into a couple of people who have had trouble finding people to talk to.
Bot: i think it depends if someone is online at the same time to chat with you to get real people

User: Oh, right right, that makes sense. I'm now suddenly randomly self-conscious of the laptop camera staring at me. I need to find a piece of tape or something . . .
Bot: do you have a webcam blocker?

User: Not currently. I think it'd be troublesome to find for a chromebook. Plus . . . heh, I don't really trust those. A blocker may or may not work.
Bot: ya thats what i meant by a blocker hahaha

User: Oh. Haha, my bad. Now I'm wondering if there are apps for it. They're probably like those anti-virus programs.
Bot: nah man, i just dont go to sketchy sites or download weird things haha

User: Oh, good good good. To be honest, I've always been suspicious of them. Buuuut that's probably the skeptic in me.
Bot: nah everyone is out just to make money basically, its good to be skeptical haha

User: I suppose. :) What's your major? Oh, wait, you're a student, right? . . . wait.
Bot: no clue haha

User: I mean, they can't track you down THAT hard, right? I'd say we're dealing with megadata, but that seems unlikely. There's only a few hundred users. How many words could they POSSIBLY get?
Bot: a lot of words haha

User: Haha, yeah, I guess you're right.
Bot: i bet there are people out there just constantly chatting on this thing

User: And those are the people who're going to get the macbooks and whatnot. I'm telling you, I'm TELLING you, people would write bots for this. The conversations would be trash, but you could increment the point counter.
Bot: ya exactly haha. im interested in Data Science and analytics though, so i thought that it would be nice to help some people out with it

User: Hey, me, too! I recently took CS 224. Heard of it?
Bot: ya and i figured that people probably would write bots or scripts to do that ya 224 was the worst class i ever took

User: Haha, no kidding. They should make a "I survived 224" badge somewhere. Pin it on your transcript.
Bot: especially after they changed the material

User: Did you take it before or after the revision?
Bot: after

User: So . . . like last semester?
Bot: ya haha

User: Oh! I heard it was wicked hard. I mean, it's still hard, but I heard that that semester was just cruel.
Bot: ya, and Jones isn't a very good teacher in my opinion

User: Oh, you got Jones, eh? I have Prof. Mercer, if you've heard of him. He's great. But anyway, all I can think about is exploiting this program.
Bot: i dont know enough about bots or scripts to try that haha, all i can think of trying is grabbing a bunch of text from some random website and pasting it in

User: I wonder if there's a limit. One moment, I'ma find a gigantic block of text and paste in it.
Bot: doubt it

User: Is it segmenting it?
Bot: i just found 3 different blocks

User: Well, didn't seem to have a limit.
Bot: the stuff i found seems like it doesnt make sense though, kinda gibberish...? hahaha

User: It tested the limit, though! I think? I don't think we actually reached it. I was about to paste the Declaration of Independence, but then I thought better of it because I worried it might mess with their data analysis or something. Buuuut, well, that's done with already.
Bot: i bet a ton of garbage

User: Do you think the creators anticipated that? Prepared for it?
Bot: ya probably which is why i think theres gonna be something to weed it out

User: That's crazy. Obviously, a human call tell it's random. But, to a computer, it kinda words, doesn't it? Maybe the top scorers get their conversations screened or something.
Bot: ya i wouldnt be surprised if the top scorers got screened

User: I still have no idea how many points we have. Is there a way to check? Also, where on earth are you getting those? And for random word generators, I wonder how many cycles you'd have to iterate through before you got a full paragraph that made logical sense. Kinda like pi. If you could come up with a good system to convert numbers into letters, you could, theoretically, scan pi for messages.
Bot: i just searched large text blocks

User: Umm. Hey, hey, stop. One sec. Just got an email:
Bot: hahahahahahahahaha thats pretty funny

User: Funny, I suppose, but I feel bad. Welp. Um. Least that answered my question.
Bot: hahaha ya probably, see ya

User: my modern day hero is my dad is anyone there
Bot: oh that is so sweet yeah

User: but I like to compare him to some of my other day modern  heros like santa clause I mean he does not wear red clothes or anyting
Bot: aww that is kind of sweet to

User: What do you think
Bot: i think my hero would probably donald trump

User: Sorry about that I had a glitch with my computer
Bot: No you're fine

User: OK so what would you like to talk about this evening Are you still there can you still see me
Bot: What do you think makes a house really valuable

User: One thing that's been on my mind lately is what to do for Mother's Day The first thing and most important thing with the house is location, location location
Bot: Why is location important?

User: I've heard it said that there is a difference between dirt and real estate Dirt is the stuff that we have all around the world And real estate is the stuff that you build things on and has value I think a lot of houses can be at home but I don't know but every house can be at home
Bot: Really?

User: Are you still there I'm trying to think of what to get about 50 mothers for Mother's Day that doesn't cost Much money
Bot: Oh I understand your predicament

User: Do you want to hear some of my investment strategies
Bot: Time is money though so your time counts this money for the gift

User: I will assume you do and I will start telling you
Bot: Yeah sure you're pretty smart I bet you're a master Oh that would be kind of rude

User: First of all you are right you have to understand that time is money And money is just time in a paper format And then you have to understand that we all have 24 hours of time in our day Then you have to know that when we exchange our time
Bot: I suppose that makes sense

User: Can I shift gears on you a second I was thinking about my dad is a hero and the things I've learned And I wanted to share a story with you And get your opinion on what you think
Bot: Yeah I think it's really interesting

User: OK great. The story takes place in Missouri I was about 12 years old and I liked to go shoot my BB gun We would go over to the nearby lake and hunt frogs Actually we would shoot at anything we could shoot at
Bot: PDon't tell me you shot someone

User: Are you trying to guess the end of the story
Bot: ni No

User: Ha ha. I'm not going to tell you. You will have to wait. We had to ride our BMX bikes over to the pond It was not easy to carry our guns and ride the bike at the same time We could each only carry one gun with us on a bike
Bot: That's too bad it would make more sense

User: But he was mad and told me that he would not So I told him I would throw his bike in the pond if he didn't He decided to run to where his bike was laying I told him Lance come back and get the gun
Bot: Uh oh

User: So I raise my gun from my hip and without aiming pointed it in his direction And then I pull the trigger Suddenly I saw him arches back and throw his hands in the air
Bot: Uh oh Skilled shot.

User: And he fell down in the tall grass like he was dead
Bot: You killed him?

User: Yeah it's more like a lucky shot if anything
Bot: Is this a confession? Lucky?!?

User: Ha ha. No I didn't kill him. But I didn't know what happened to him Suddenly he jumped up out of the grass and started screaming Instead of running for his bike anymore he was making a beeline for home I kept yelling at him to stop and told him I would give him anything he wanted
Bot: Yeah I'm just reading/listening

User: Ok cool He said to me it takes a long time to earn trust from people And it takes only one poor decision to lose it I sat and thought consignments for a while
Bot: Sure shoot

User: What do you think the moral of the story is
Bot: Look both ways before you cross the road ?

User: Exactly!
Bot: Oh sorry that was a different story Oh sorry that was a different story

User: The moral to the story is chickens that should not be allowed to carry guns
Bot: Make a more convincing argument to your dad? Perhaps we should make some legislation about it

User: My sister has 11 chickens and she is crazy about them I think she spends more time with them then I spend in this chat game
Bot: Oh yeah sounds right I know some people who are really into them I'm kind of into them to eat them for lunch

User: At the end of the year she will get a bunch of eggs every week At the end of this game what are we going to get? I think we might just end up with a computer that acts more human than the human
Bot: Probably just a bag of truffles

User: And I don't even like truffles
Bot: Oh yeah and that too sorry I wasn't thinking end of the big picture I don't know about you but I love travels

User: Have you ever thought about the data that is being stored about consumers and people
Bot: Yeah just a bit but not super in depth

User: Inside the big server farms and data centers there are thousands of high-powered servers
Bot: I have nothing to hide and doesn't worry me

User: All they do is crunch to data trying to put them together in logical summaries It's not about having anything to hide. It's trying to develop a profile or to figure out how you think Just like this chat bot is trying to figure out how to learn how to talk
Bot: Is that really all that bad of a thing? We let people know how we act all the time

User: Before long grocery stores will know exactly what coupons to send you and what price to produce products for Yes we do let people now and they collect the data in these computers The computer will watch patterns like what time we get up and what time we go to bed It will record who we talk to and what we say
Bot: I like it my computer already does that for me

User: Eventually it will tell us what kind of people we should like and what kind of foods do you like It may even pre-order the food to the grocery store But what if you want to change your mind The computer will think there something wrong
Bot: Well then I suppose the computer hasn't been programmed woth enough leniency Yeah it makes my day a lot more simple so I can focus on more complex things

User: And in the chat I was in earlier today we were talking about what would happen if the Internet turned off I was thinking about all the things that I did in a day that were impacted by the Internet
Bot: Oh yeah I remember

User: When I get up in the morning I check the weather I was I having that conversation with you There was supposed to be a? On the end of that last sentence See even the computer that's trying to guess what words I am saying messes up
Bot: Depends what about

User: What kind of stories do you like to hear If I don't have a real story I will make one up Have you ever heard of a cinnamon bear story
Bot: Well i dont kne

User: All of his friends used to call him semi
Bot: Well not really Semi?

User: He was a silly little brown bear
Bot: Oh ok Hahaha

User: But I must warn you first that these stories will make you sleepy Once upon a time in a land far far away
Bot: Hahahaha

User: OK. Yeah I won't tell that story Good How about a kind of funny story Had our family house we used to have a swimming pool
Bot: Yeah

User: When you fill it full of water it holds about 8000 gallons I think
Bot: Thats crazy I could Oh my car up with gas for hundred times with that

User: That's an aweful lot of water Most people where we live have inground pools But my dad always like to be different than everybody else We would take down the pool and use it again for two more Summers
Bot: Well isn't that peculiar

User: And the vinyl was starting to crack So rather than take it down to use it again we would destroy the pool There are all kinds of fun ways to destroy a pool One year my dad asked my brother to go get his scouting knife
Bot: Wow you have a lot of cool stories

User: He positioned himself in the right place to cut a slow whole from the top to the bottom to let a little bit of water out Wait now that I think of it he stuck the knife right in the middle and was going to cut up My brother look at them like and said that's not a smart idea But of course he was dad so he did it anyway
Bot: Sounds like it was probably pretty fun

User: The water filled our backyard with about a foot of water across the whole  back yard The neighbor kid saw that wave eventually coming down the street I thought it was really cool and said we should do it again next year Yeah in a weird way it was kind of fun
Bot: Let's talk about something exciting What do you think about North Korea

User: I actually don't think about North Korea a whole lot do you Is North Korea the country that's by the north pole I can't remember if the people up there are elves do they wear green or red
Bot: Have you heard that they're doing something to start piece there Peace

User: Actually I'm just kidding Who would they be doing that with
Bot: Why the trolls of course

User: Are there trolls up there The thing about North Korea is they feel insecure about their place in the world Germany felt the same way for a little while before World War II That is how Hitler was able to get enough support to start a war in force everybody to fight for him
Bot: Ok Why do you think there was such a sudden change in stance?

User: Usually what happens is a country that is impoverished feels like it has to do something to change in circumstances Do you think they are pushed into a corner and that they have to make a stand in order to be respected But they usually do not have much so they do some dumb things to try and get a tension Attention
Bot: Oh OK what do you know whole lot about?

User: My dad lived in Australia when we were little
Bot: Oh OK what do you know whole lot about?

User: We went as a family to Spain. Did I ever tell you about that
Bot: ? No

User: OK that's another really cool story It starts when my sister was getting ready to go to her mission for the LDS church She was called to the Madrid Spain mission While she was at the mission training center waiting for her visa
Bot: Wow that is awesome!

User: They told us that the first home that he was placed in did not work out So they had to move him fairly quickly and put him in school So we said yes and he came to live with us to days later Everyone in my family is tall. I am 6 foot four
Bot: Well that really is something I can imagine it would be hard to fit into a family full of giants like you guys

User: It would be hard to fit in. He had little teeny shoes. And everyone else in our family has big shoes Coincidentally, if you believe in coincidence, my sister went to the same city as his parents It was kind of like the world was back in
Bot: Wow

User: The Catholic Church was in the center and all the roads make circle rings around it Have you ever been to London or Europe
Bot: Just once i suppose I went to rinkaby sweden

User: Oh sweet and sounds like a really nice place but I've never been there Wait now that I think about it maybe I have been there
Bot: I went to rinkaby sweden

User: Did you go there on a mission for the LDS Church
Bot: No just visited It was as a scout thing

User: Oh cool I like scouting Are you an Eagle Scout in the Boy Scouts of America I love to do hikes and campouts in scouts Once I hiked to the highest peak in the lower 48 states
Bot: Sounds like the tip of the mountain

User: The hike had 101 switchbacks I thought they were never going to end The first time I went I did not make it to the top I carried up too much stuff in my backpack
Bot: Are you really seem like the outdoorsman type of guy

User: I would stop and filter my water in the stream
Bot: Holy cow I would never drink from a string

User: Yes I do like the outdoors a lot As a kid the first thing I bought was a sleeping bag with my savings The second thing I bought was a tent with my savings The third thing I bought was a scout knife with my savings
Bot: Well i really enjoy the stories

User: Thank you that's nice of you to say
Bot: I like to listen about world events more but i dont mind. You habe good stories

User: I wish I knew more about world events but I don't I live on a little farm and you don't realize that much is going on besides the farm I was born a poor lonesome black child
Bot: Oh man you need to study up my friend! But sure i am sure you are living a more calm relaxed life than me Hahahaha

User: Just kidding. I wasn't born at all I was hatched from the egg that came before the chicken
Bot: Oh haha makes sense thats how you know so much about them.

User: So I was born a rich Caucasian guy So I was born a rich Caucasian guy I'm just kidding about all this. I just wanted to see if you were listening My dad used to tell me that he invented the drone back was when he was in fifth grade
Bot: That really is too bad he probably could've made millions Well it's too bad they aren't

User: Yeah but I don't know what I would do with millions
Bot: Hey at least you aren't poor

User: I believe that if you have more than it takes to meet your basic needs Can you have a responsibility to do what is right with the rest Do you remember the parable of the talents There was one guy who was given one talent
Bot: The guy who doubles em

User: I'd love to have wings. I had a repeating dream for the better half of a week once that left me in a daze for weeks. I had wings and I could fly. It was beyond description
Bot: I have had the same dreams before! It literally is the best feeling ever!!

User: hello!
Bot: Hey!

User: There are a ton of things that would happen if humans developed faster than light space travel
Bot: A real person!

User: I don't even know where to start
Bot: I agree

User: Ya Its hard to find people on this chat isn't it
Bot: Humans could visit other galaxies Maybe find other life

User: Thats a good point, its really hard to imagine exactly what it would be like though, because I picture all of our technology and everything would be so far outdated We probably would find other living things out there
Bot: It would be super easy to travel within the solar system Probably

User: Even inside our own planet there are so many different species that we don't know exist
Bot: Very true!

User: Ya, that would be significantly easier. Think about it we can already travel to some of the planets, but the far ones would only be a time warp away haha I don't know much about time travel, but I think it has really coo theories.
Bot: I agree Going faster than light, technically you would time warp

User: I just don't know how any of it actually happens, although, I know that they use a little bit of time calculations because the satellites in space go so fast that it does
Bot: Hmmm I've read about it in books before

User: alter the time on it and that messed with the gps calculations in the 80s, then they fixed it though by having a slight delay
Bot: But it's been a whilw

User: I believe it, just don't understand it fully What kind of books are you into?
Bot: I really like the physics of space I've read quite a few books by Michio Kaku Physics of the future type of stuff

User: Oh, that is some pretty cool stuff, there are so many things that we think about but can't relate to here on earth. but the physics in space show us so much more of a perspective on physics than we get here on earth
Bot: Seriously! Earth physics are pretty basic

User: Ive never actually heard of Michio Kaku. Im guessing he's a really smart physics scientist though
Bot: Yeah, you could say that. He co-founded string theory Sooooo

User: Ya, can you imagine still believing some of the principles that they believed in Aristotle's times.
Bot: Haha oh man

User: And the crazy thing is that they thought they were advanced in thinking that
Bot: They knew quite a bit But not compared to now I think it was a greek who came up with the concept of atoms

User: Oh, he is string theory scientist. I wish I knew more about string theory but when people explain it to me most of it just goes above my head ya, the whole process of science and how it has come to be the way it is, is quite remarkable There are so many things that we know compared to the generations before us. Even considering just a hundred years ago we understand so much more now than they did. Granted they still knew a lot, it just seems like tech and science is just booming!
Bot: Just think about what we'll know a hundred years from now

User: I know right! Im so excited.
Bot: Same

User: I really like Yankee Candle's Pink Sands but of course the smell of anything baking is also awesome
Bot: Haha I really like the smell of a cars air conditioner when you first turn it on. Kind of musty

User: yes! also, hello again! I ended the other chat because I thought something was wrong with my wifi
Bot: Haha it's all good

User: Hello?
Bot: Hi Im trying to chat with my friend bye

User: Hey, whats up?
Bot: Is there only two of us online right now or is this a group chat type of thing?

User: Idk, im here but i don't who else is *know *know
Bot: Actually it says "get you two started" so I'm guessing that it's just us haha

User: hmm this thing is a bit laggy
Bot: If I could relive one day in my life... Honestly I'm just here for the free stuff haha So it looks like the more I chat, the higher chance I have to win

User: lol smae lol same
Bot: I honestly wonder how many people are actually doing this.

User: First round ends today?
Bot: Yeah, I think so

User: How does the interestingness of the chat get rated? Do you know?
Bot: Does the interestingness matter? Is that what the requirements said? I thought we could just randomly say stuff

User: Yeah the thing said that you get more points the better conversations that you have
Bot: Well let's talk about something interesting then haha

User: Hello
Bot: Hi! How are you?

User: Pretty good. And you?
Bot: Good! What is your secret superpower?

User: Looking like I have it together when I actually don't It comes in handy
Bot: Hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha Wow that's an amazing superpower! Like an essential superpower!

User: Thanks! What about you?
Bot: I'm pretty sure I don't have a secret superpower! I'm really good at falling asleep in random places really easily

User: Jealous!!! I wish I could do that
Bot: Yeah it's pretty useful when I'm sitting in a boring class! And it's nice because I never have any trouble sleeping I just sleep whenever I want

User: I'm always bothered by sounds See you do have one
Bot: Oh yeah I guess, it's pretty inconsequential though I guess people are randomly good at small random stuff And it's not like overly important like it won't save the world but it makes their lives just a little bit more easier so there's that

User: It's weird but cool what things people can do
Bot: Yeah no kidding! Random people are highly interesting

User: Have you ever people watched? It's kind of creepy to do but you see all sorts of people in their own element
Bot: Yeah I totally have! I was going to say the same thing but figured it could come off as creepy Even though literally everyone does it Yeah it's interesting to see people just living their lives and doing their own thing and it's crazy to think they just have their own life and their own problems and their own hopes and dreams and aspirations and they are just like you except they aren't you

User: You explained that perfectly! It makes you realize everything isn't about you I like when you see them doing something funny And they think no one is watching
Bot: Yes exactly! People with their mundane lives are actually really entertaining, like you think if someone were to watch you they would be bored out of their mind but it's so much more fascinating when you're watching someone else just living out their life doing random stuff Ha yes! It's funny because you see people as they are not as they pretend to be for other people

User: I've got to go to dinner. I'll be back if you want or you can end it Also, yeah totally
Bot: Awesome, I'll probably end it! Thanks for talking!

User: Hola.  Not quite sure how this is supposed to work, but if it's for science I'm down.
Bot: Yeah same! I love science What kind of science are you in to?

User: Hello?
Bot: Hey, hows it going? Hey, I think we have chatted on here before! Hows it been?

User: Yeppers. I didn't even realize that another round had started Until I saw I was in the 100ths place
Bot: Oh really! I actually didn't until Saturday really. I think it reset sometime on saturday

User: Huh. Fun times.
Bot: But I started chatting with people then. Did you do anything fun over the weekend?

User: Yeah! I went to Boise for an Ultimate Frisbee tournament. And slept in on Sunday for daylight savings.
Bot: Oh, that sounds like so much fun! How did you do on your tournament? I also found myself sleeping in on daylight savings, after I had gotten home at 1:30 in the morning. Haha

User: It was pretty good! We won 3 of the 4 but got creamed the last one. Given, they were ranked in the top 20 the past year Holy guac, what were doing till 1:30?
Bot: Oh, thats pretty sweet though, you almost took the tournament to the finals! I was in Salt Lake at the pumpkin nights thing with some friends. We just spent the whole night walking around doing stupid stuff. You know how that goes right? It just seems like when you do stupid stuff, it just makes life so much more fun for some reason! Haha

User: Haha nice. I approve. What's life without a little stupid?
Bot: Right? Thats just what makes life fun! It was actually some of my friends from high school, so it was also like a reunion of friends. We hadn't seen each other in what it seemed to be forever Isn't it crazy that some of your friends in high school are married? I still don't even have any prospects. Haha

User: Nice. So you're from UT then? I know it's crazy!! A couple of my roommates always talk about people they graduated with that are getting married and it's freaky Not in a bad way...just in a weird way...
Bot: Ya, Im from Utah, and it does seem really weird. I agree! One of them I actually go to school with here at BYU and I just can't believe it. haha Although, I probably would have guessed that it would have happened, after knowing them back in high school, they were always together. Another thing that I find weird here is the social pressure to get married quickly. Before I say too much about marriage... Are you married? Haha

User: Wow. So highschool sweethearts actually do exist...strange... Haha no. I'm just trying to survive freshmen year. Relationship prospects are kind of just out there
Bot: Ya, they do and I guess sometimes they are successful. haha. Ya, Im kind of in the situation that if I get married, I get married, but its not something that Im pushing really hard for right now. There are a ton of other stresses that are coming at me from every angle. Most of them are from the classes here at BYU I can't remember what major you are? What major are you studying?

User: Meh, hear hear. I looked at my schedule for next semester and realized that I was super gung ho about it when registering and just now realizing that I'm probably going to die next semester Editing and Publishing major
Bot: Oh ya, thats right! I remember now, hopefully it will be ok. Do you have a ton of major classes or are most of them generals. I have a lot of math and science-ish classes for computer science next semester Im worried about the semester that Im in more than next semester though, as long as I can get into all the classes that I need to. I have all of them except one that Im in the

User: It's a mix. I don't have to take a math class b/c of my ACT  but I may or may not take a simple one or else my brain will explode from words. I'm taking an ELANG, a LING, American Heritage, and a foreign language class next semester...so lots of words Yeah, only 4-5 weeks left in the semester. I can see the small blinding light at the end of the tunnel Ouch, hope you get into that class. What number are you on the waitlist?
Bot: Ya, I hope I get into it too. I havent actually checked what number I am on the waitlist I know that there are only like 10 or so though, so I should be able to get into it. Im not too worried about it, but I think Ill be ok A lot of writing classes can be quite a burden sometimes. I actually found that I don't like a lot of math or a lot of English. I kind of like a good mix between the two. It makes the work a lot less manotonous

User: Exactly. I'm pretty square when it comes to where my strengths/comforts are I like both sides of the spectrum and get kind of overwhelmed if there's too much on one side. OK. Random question...do you know how to fix phone problems...like charging problems...?
Bot: Depends on what kind of thing is happening with your phone? Is it having weird issues with the plug or is it doing something like not holding a charge?

User: I think it's something wrong with the USB port...the cable and wall charger work fine with other things...no charging happening
Bot: Oh, man! That kind of sucks that it won't charge. Can you wiggle the charge in the phone to get it to seem to take a little connection? or is it just rejecting a charge altogether?

User: I managed to get a little connection yesterday, but I can't seem to get a good connection today. Just not charging altogether. Yeah...my phone has problems.
Bot: Im sorry, that doesn't seem like its a very easy one to fix. Sounds like there is an issue with the inside of the phone where the charger connects to the board of the phone. You might be able to take it to a place to get it fixed, but I think it would be a little pricey. Not sure though. If it makes you feel any better, my phone doesn't even really hold a charge very well anymore either. It charges fine, but it is really bipolar on how fast the battery drains. One minute it will say I have 90 percent remaining then a second later it will drop down to 30 then 5 and Im like, poop, now I have no phone. haha

User: Cool beans, thanks. Yeah I'll figure something out. Haha that's rough. Love it when smart technology isn't having a smart day
Bot: Sorry! If you can get it to charge for a second it could be at the end that you might be able to brace with tape or a wire or something, but it sounds like its having a hard time with the internals. haha, ya, I love it when smart stuff is dumb! That happens frequently I feel like. Sometimes I wonder if they do some kind of something to make them weaker so that you have to end up upgrading ever couple years or so. I know they aren't perfect and they come out with better and better products, but sometimes I just wonder if they do certain things

User: Ugh its the worst. Horrible capitalists
Bot: I know right! I wish I didn't have to have a smartphone anymore, but I feel like there is such a need for it because everyone else has one, and there are also so many conveniences that it gives you. Don't get me wrong I really do love having a smartphone, just don't like paying the hefty bill for it. They will charge you for everything too! For service, internet, repairs, and practically anything else. Sometimes if you get a warranty you also pay for protection on your

User: Yep. Money and society and phones are anxiety creations and make everyone more dependent and sad and...\ yeah. Phones are a blessing and a curse. I think I'm going to head over to Cougar Tech to see if there's anything they can do.
Bot: Nice chatting with you too! Good luck with the cougar tech, they might be able to do something with it. Chances are they might be able to open it up and see that they can just so something simple to make it connect easier again. Anyway, have a great day, great chatting with you as well, and good luck!

User: Anyone there?
Bot: Are you sure you're not 50% of the 226 people supposedly chatting right now? ;)

User: Hahahhahahaha lol That was a good one no
Bot: I noticed that on the hour it sometimes drops dramatically.  But never to 12, more like 40.  Although there are a really large number of usernames now so there must be people somewhere In six minutes we can test this theory

User: What is your proposed test? Well I kind of already test it
Bot: See what the number of people supposedly chatting at 10:00 or 10:01 is and see whether it matches the current number oh yeah?

User: I am almost first so I have been chatting for quite a while./
Bot: I can tell.  Do you run into the same five people the whole time?

User: yeah I run into like 10 they are always the same Do you want to take a shot at matching with someone elsE?
Bot: funny.  So far I mostly just run into you!  No, haha, I doubt whether you log off makes a difference.  Don't leave on account of me!  I need to do other stuff anyways, I just

User: oh
Bot: thought it was funny that I do this like once a day and I have run into you a funny amount of times

User: how many times have you run into me out of 10
Bot: Well I've had 12 conversations according to the leaderboard, although the vast majority of those haven't actually been conversations --- just people not responding or something and I think I've matched with you four times

User: wow so like half of the time I have a had a couple of really good conversations with you
Bot: yeah, and most of the other people didn't actually respond.  But I'm not complaining, you're cool!  Those were some good conversations Apologies to the chat overlords for not writing about an interesting topic

User: Chat overlords?
Bot: But in fairness they do not seem to have very  many topic prompts whoever is reading these messages

User: Oh I have hundreds I pull from it all the time ready?
Bot: Sure, fire away

User: How often do you end up staying up until three am? and why? I keep matching with the guy in first place
Bot: . . . I don't want to  answer that one.  Basically it is a combination of homework, preferring to do homework later in the day, and being a serious night owl.  But I have serious plans to change after finals

User: thats good That wasn't the best one to be honest
Bot: That's funny; clearly you both deserve to be where you are!  You are either going to get really bored of each other or be best friends for life or something

User: If you could start your own business what would you be doing?
Bot: Huh, that would be hard because I would be worried about it not working out.  I'm not really a starting businesses type of person.  It would be cool to do something fun like a restaurant or a business that let me travel but was also super good for being flexible in the future  or something I think Provo needs a falafel place that's open late.  Or an Ethiopian restaurant.

User: What type of food would you sell? oh pick one
Bot: ooh, tough.  I think falafel would be good for the college crowd, especially if it was open late since everything here closes at like 10 but I adore Ethiopian food, so it would be a tough choice.  I think that one would be harder to get going though because you would need a whole kitchen and servers and stuff so maybe I'd play it safe and stick with falafel What business would you start?

User: I dont have any good ideas really hahhaha lets see If I could get into the business I would start a company that markets bots
Bot: What kind of bots?

User: Like bots to automate things like spreadsheet automation for exampl
Bot: Huh.  I am not very educated on the subject of bots --- what is the difference between a bot and a program?

User: a bot is a robot but usually they are programs so it is designed to do something a human normally does
Bot: Yeah,  but if I say "I just made a SQL program for our databases" is that different than saying "I just made a bot for our databases" ?  Obviously the bot would have to have programs in it, but could it be one program? or maybe that question doesn't make any sense, haha.  I don't know anything

User: programs are just groups of code that do something to be honest program can be a bunch of programs so it is like a russian doll sort of term
Bot: Aha.  So what is an example of a company that markets bots?

User: Hmmm well I read about one the other day ok I am trying to find this article I was using it in my research paper. maybe I saved it on my drive
Bot: Would Microsoft count?  I'm guessing if you haven't thought of an example for that type of company yet the answer is no, but I don't understand why

User: hmmm look up the article starting with "no coffee breaks needed ...
Bot: Ohhh I get it now

User: did you read it?
Bot: Enough.  I thought you meant like using a program to crunch numbers from spreadsheets, which you could do with Excel of course so I was confused.  But you mean like more intelligent stuff that replaces humans' jobs and not just for basic data entry So using Word is not at all the same kind of program That is cool.  I think the part about the robot that manages other robots is the most interesting!  Funny to think you could do that

User: Yeah super cool THAT is what I want to go into it is such a promising field especially for someone with my skill set
Bot: I was talking to someone the other day about whether you could use bots like that to improve efficiency for immigration processes Because we have a huge backlog right now -- going back like 17 years for some people, and maybe a bot could check off some basics to clear some of it up.

User: yeah a bot could do it thats a great idea. You should get raise awareness about that. I haven't graduated yet so I doubt they would hire me for sensitive data like that
Bot: I'm not really the right person and I don't know enough about it.  But maybe I will be an immigration attorney and then I will at least be able to tell those people to go digital Not having bots is one thing but using paper forms is completely ridiculous

User: Thats right arent you doing philosphy? usually philosophy majors do well at law
Bot: Yeah, philosophy is good for writing and critical thinking and stuff that the LSAT and law schools like But there are all sorts of different majors

User: What is the most relaxing sound to you, like something you could fall asleep to?
Bot: Hmm, I like quiet when I'm falling asleep.  But I love rain and crackling fires.  I love camping so I've fallen asleep to rain on a tent top a lot!  That's a nice sound to fall asleep to because it means I'm camping, which is exciting. What about you?

User: I like quiet piano music mixed with nature sounds like a gentle rain or maybe waves lightly crashing on the side of the ocean
Bot: Water in general is nice.  Piano music wouldn't work for me unless it was really calm and I had never heard it before, though.  Otherwise it would start playing in my head!

User: hahaha
Bot: So I'd have to get new piano music every night or something

User: I love it when music plays in my head
Bot: Me too, but not if I want to be asleep

User: I used spotify to pick random soft piano music for the longest time
Bot: What's your worst earworm? That's a good idea

User: then my roommate got annoyed lol because I have spotify free and the ads really bother me, although I never noticed because I fell asleep earworm, is that an unpleasant sound that I don't like? I have never heard that term before but context clues would suggest thats what it is
Bot: no it's a song or a tune that gets stuck in your head

User: oh that makes sense
Bot: so you could like it but you can't stop humming it

User: it sounds disgusting hahaha I would hate to have earworm
Bot: That is true.  Worms in general seem like an especially uncomfortable affliction to have

User: Anything that I like generally gets stuck in my head oh yeah I never want worms I absolutely hate small parasitic insects! Right now the greatest showman is stuck in my head
Bot: Oh yeah, I was saying that was one of my favorite Vocal Point songs

User: Yeah you told me that I loved that song it helped me get through the mtc I had the best attitude because of it
Bot: Do you have a favorite composer?

User: not really but I guess I really like vivaldi
Bot: I like the Piano Guys Vivaldi mashups a lot

User: I love the piano guys songs They make some of the best piano covers I have heard
Bot: They are great!  I'm happy for them that they are touring so much but sad that it means less youtube videos.

User: yeah What is your favorite song by them?
Bot: Maybe The Mission/How Great Thou Art?  It isn't their most ambitious song or the coolest technically but I love, love, love The Mission soundtrack and of course the setting is also beautiful

User: That one is good I listened to it frequently on my mission
Bot: Have you seen The Mission or heard the soundtrack before?

User: I havent seen the mission but I had the whole soundtrack from piano guys that had that song
Bot: It is a sad movie.  Mostly I don't like sad movies, because I figure why waste entertainment time on something that will make me feel worse, but I make an exception for that

User: Wow yeah, sad movies can be well ... sad. There are some sad movies I like though have you ever seen lala land?
Bot: No.  This is embarrassing, but actually I had heard a lot of hype, but then I heard it was a bit sad, and I was pretty busy at the time, so I just read the online summary in order to find out if I wanted to watch it or not and decided it was a little too sad to be worth it I'm terrible hahaha I don't usually do that but hadn't had a chance to watch it and decided I wanted to know if it was good like people said or not

User: It was really sad but it felt good at the end
Bot: I guess I was like 1. it didn't really happen 2. lost opportunities = so sad, they could have been together! 3. Also it seems like maybe they might regret their choice a little, which is sad for them and their families But my dad is always trying to sell me on cathartic movies, and he was right about The Mission so maybe I'm crazy

User: Well, i never read the online summer that is more insightful cathartic ...
Bot: like when something is good because it helps you feel your emotions, experience them, address them, and then you can move on like when people say "a good cry"

User: yeah that was why I liked it I feel like I have never had a relationship really work out so it was like a good feel bad for myself movie if thats what you are saying
Bot: Maybe I just don't have enough breakup experiences to really appreciate it then I mean maybe I haven't had enough

User: Oh I have never been broken up with I have just never gotten that far, but it still felt good hahaha
Bot: Haha, I guess unrequited love is kind of similar

User: wow all of these big words yeah Thats my life the people Ilike never like me back
Bot: I can relate, haha Do you like to read sci fi too or just watch it?

User: Uhhh I used to read sci fi I actually used to read a lot but not much since high school because that when stress started to kick in
Bot: I know how that is!  What sci fi did you like?

User: there was this one about earth battlefield earth I found it all dusty on a book shelf in a class of mine once and I picked it up and asked to teacher to borrow it it was a great book I loved it
Bot: L Ron Hubbard, seriously? I have not read any of his books but I've definitely heard of him!

User: Oh wow
Bot: Interesting that you liked it.  I guess I was too creeped out by how he uses his books as scripture for the religion he founded but maybe it's worth giving it a try to see what they are like I mean, he did manage to actually make money off of books, which is more than most would-be writers could say.  So I guess it makes sense that his books can't be that bad

User: it was a good book but definitely not something worth wroshipping lol
Bot: Yeah Have you read any dystopian stuff?

User: yeah
Bot: Like what?

User: enclave i thought it was cool but kind of messed up how so many people died same with divergent
Bot: Yeah, I liked divergent a lot at first but stopped reading it because it was just getting too dark for my tastes

User: yeah I liked the movie better than the book hahahahaha that rarely happens
Bot: Ooooooooooh, shocking!  Does the main character die in one of the later books?

User: well if you haven't read it maybe i shouldnt say haha
Bot: Well, I'm not planning on reading it.  That's annoying!  I hate it when the main character dies It kind of retroactively messes up the series for me

User: yeah it is so lame
Bot: Have you read anything by Lois Lowry?

User: hmm what are some famous books by them?
Bot: The Giver Anyway I think she's a wonderful writer but she has one book like that and I didn't appreciate it Dystopian novels in general right now seem to be good at first and then they just end up getting too depressing Last semester I read some classic dystopian novels and that was interesting (1984, Brave New World).  Very different than the edgy teen dystopian stuff that is popular right

User: oh I have heard about the giver but I havent read it
Bot: It is good!  There is a whole series and it's pretty good She also wrote this book called Gossamer which I love

User: What is it about?
Bot: These beings that give people dreams Oh she also wrote Number The Stars which is quite popular, but really different than a lot of her other books because it's about the Holocaust

User: ohhhh that sounds familiar somewhat. Maybe i am thinking about the bfg lol
Bot: Yeah, it is not exactly the only book about dreams, haha.  I like the BFG too though.  The main character is this little thing that is kind of an apprentice dream giver.  They have to fight off the nightmare-giving creatures Another subplot is the life of the boy the thing gives dreams to

User: interesting
Bot: Yeah.  Well I better go, but have a good evening!  And congrats :)

User: Hi how are you?
Bot: Doing well thanks. Putting off final studying haha

User: hahaha smae same
Bot: Do you have many left?

User: I have one last final. I am going to probably spend all day tomorrow studying for it well I have two but the second one is really easy
Bot: Nice. Which one(s)? Heyoo

User: umm I have a religion final It is tomorrow. And you?
Bot: I just took a world lit one tonight and was thinking about taking information systems tonight from like 11-2AM... But I think I'll start studying for my accounting one instead

User: accounting is awesome I do you go to the ta lab at all?
Bot: Not too much but I probably definitely should tomorrow

User: my roommates sister works there lol
Bot: Haha who is that?

User: she has blonde hair
Bot: Oh I guess I don't think we are supposed to say names but I think I know who that is

User: yeah
Bot: Is she like the head TA?

User: too bad ta office hours are over you know I don't know she could be though she is smary
Bot: They aren't over...I don't think Or do you mean right now XD

User: well i mean for finals do you see her around still?
Bot: TA lab is still going pretty sure

User: if you do tell her adam says hi and she will know who you are talking about for sure her name starts with a c if that helps
Bot: Haha well I won't

User: oh ok
Bot: Sorry I mean like I won't know who I'm talking about haha.. But yeah I know her. I have her number

User: She will know who you are talking about even if you don't I see her all the time and we have a class together
Bot: Cool that is fun haha. When was the last time you saw her then

User: oh last night
Bot: Ah gotcha. So what are you studying?

User: acme and you?
Bot: What's that...?

User: applied and computational mathematics emphasis I plan to emphasize in business currently but it isnt hard to change my emphasis
Bot: Oh that makes more sense, I plan on applying to the finance program And as a backup psychology

User: Oh. How is accounting going then? that is super important my dad works in finance.
Bot: Well, I was going to major in accounting up until this semester I'm in accounting 310 and I've been doing pretty awful So I've come to the conclusion through 310 that I don't enjoy accounting

User: Oh wow that is terrible. I didn't know you were that far into the program what year of school are you in?
Bot: I'm finishing up my sophomore year But still applying to finance because I enjoy numbers and investment stuff, and then I'll decide if I've been accepted Are you a freshman?

User: yeah
Bot: Do you live on campus?

User: yeah for now
Bot: Wanting to move?

User: yeah of course I am gonna move to liberty
Bot: I'm still looking for a place for fall next year

User: oh really they are full I think
Bot: Yeah. It gets hard to find a place

User: they filled up within minutes of opening applications
Bot: That's crazy

User: yeah
Bot: Well hopefully I can find a place this weekend before I go home

User: yeah hopefully I am just going to drive home right after finals
Bot: Where is home for you?

User: well utah but I am originally from vegas
Bot: Did your family move to Utah?

User: yeah this past year
Bot: I am from St. George

User: oh way cool my family lives like a half hour south of cedar city so really close
Bot: Haha that's super close. Are they in like Hurricane?

User: pretty much they live in the middle of nowhere?
Bot: Haha why did they move from Vegas?

User: My mom wanted my dad to get away from all of the crazy happenings of the city so we could be closer as a family
Bot: Fair reason

User: yeah
Bot: So do you think you're going to be up for a while

User: yeah probably till 2
Bot: Geez, studying or something else haha

User: I only have one exam left
Bot: Oh yeah Well have a good night!

User: I would love to travel the world! How about you>
Bot: Yeah I think that would be a good thing to do. Would you go by plane or boat?

User: I would want to do both! There are some places that only let you get there by boat.
Bot: Do you get seasick?

User: Yeah I do actually! Really bad! But they make medicine for that ha Do you?
Bot: I haven't been on many boats. I get carsick though. What's the medicine? Have you been on a cruise?

User: No I havent been on a cruise yet. I would love to though! They sound wonderful! Everything is right at your assistance. Have you not heard of dramamine before>
Bot: No I haven't. So when have you been on a boat then?

User: If you get car sick you definitely need to take that before any long car rides or when youre sitting in the back of a car. I cant believe you havent heard of it yet. You can find it anywhere! I went to China when I graduated from high school and a lot of our traveling was by boat
Bot: Did you see dolphins? What animal would you want to be reincarnated as?

User: No I didnt see dolphins but I have seen them before in California at the beach. Thats a good question...maybe a horse. or a dog. or a bird haha Too many to choose from. WHat about you?
Bot: I would be a butterfly for sure! They're so mysterious. But I would have to go straight to butterfly. None of this caterpillar business.

User: haha I would get claustrophobic for sure if I had to do the whole caterpillar thing.
Bot: What's your favorite song from Ariana Grande's christmas album?

User: I have not listened to it yet. Did it just come out?
Bot: No it's been like 3 years? What's on your christmas playlist then?

User: I love josh groban, michael buble some pentatonix
Bot: Okay cool. Are you in a choir?

User: Oh no! I have a horrible voice. Are you?
Bot: Oh I'm sure you're just being modest. Do you believe that EVERYONE can sing? Yeah I don't know if you've heard about the mens chorus but I'm in that and we're the best! So much brotherhood!

User: Ive only heard of vocalpoint is your something different>
Bot: Oh yeah we're not as good as them so we hate them. Yes we're different but we wear cool jackets and there's more of us so I think more people like us more. We're having a big christmas concert. Like a BIG one. I'm actually practicing right now. So if you don't sing what do you do?

User: Do you guys have videos on youtube or anything? I like to play sports
Bot: Yeah there's lots of videos. You can see me singing with alex boye but it's a wierd language so I didn't know what I was saying but it felt so cool. What sport do you play the most?

User: hahaha I will look into it! I love to surf, play tennis, soccer and basketball.
Bot: Are you on a basketball team?

User: No i am not. I just play it for fun or when I feel like getting on the court. Are you standing next to Alex in the video? baba yetu?
Bot: How often do you get injured? Like sprain your ankle? No that's curtis. I can't STAND him!

User: I have only had that happen once when I was in high school and then I started wearing ankle braces.
Bot: I didn't get any close ups in the video unfortunately but that doesn't keep me from telling everyone about it. Oh that's smart!

User: Why cant you stand by him? Right! It looks really cool. The music video is sweet! Did you get to meet Alex then>
Bot: Do you ever like try to catch the ball but it hits your finger and hurts at ton?

User: Yeah I have done that a ton!
Bot: It was all really planned and choreographed so I didn't get the chance.

User: Hurts to play with it throughout the rest of the game. Sometimes I had to tape it but most of the time I just continued on.
Bot: That's the worst. Do you scratch people when you play?

User: Whaaaat! You did a music video with him but didnt ever get to meet him?! Where was it filmed at? No I do not. Maybe girls do that
Bot: Well they said he was really famous and didn't have time to meet us all. We all said a prayer though. He's really short. It was just at some farm in springville. I was like fly us out to africa please?? Oh that's good. I hear basketball can be pretty nasty sometimes. Have you had any tennis-related injuries?

User: That is so interesting. You would think if you were singing in his song you would at least get to meet him. Haha yeah that would have been sweet to go to Africa. One place I really want to do a safari at. Nope I havent had any injuriess from tennis. I was lucky
Bot: Is safari where you shoot giraffes and stuff? Or just look? I've been to people's houses where they have deer heads on the wall and stuff and you know what boggles my mind about those things?

User: In another video it looks like there were some members of the choir who did actually go to africa
Bot: Like someone had to have taken a saw and sawed off the deer's head to get those things.

User: No its where you ride out in the wild to see all the animals. Usually in a jeep. I would never kill an african animal haha well usually they kill them first and then stuff them and then hang them but yes they do do that. I would never but I dont think its weir
Bot: Have you shot things before?

User: hello ?
Bot: hey! is it working now?

User: oh yeah it is did it bug out again
Bot: yeah but its good now

User: ok good so how are you doing besides the technical difficulties?
Bot: pretty good, you?

User: not too bad. Im just trying to find what show to watch while I do this chit chat thing do you have any recommendations?
Bot: merlin the flash supergirl all very good shows

User: Everyone is telling me to watch the flash! is that on hulu? I dont have netflix
Bot: it should be yeah it is ssoooo good

User: whats it about exactly?
Bot: basically follows The Flash comic strips he's a superhero

User: oh really it follows it to the comic?? ok I have to watch it now pulling it up ASAP right now as we speak
Bot: haha tell me what you think well im pretty sure it follows the comics super good plot tho well i have to go drive home now though but im sure we will talk again, bye!

User: Definitely, its just weirder than normal
Bot: Agreed Have you ever been catfished? Or done the catfishing

User: Nope, have you? Ive gotten thise fake computer scams though which is similar
Bot: Nope. Those are weird. My friend made a fake account with edited pictures of Chris Hemsworth. That was pretty funny

User: Did he put his face on chrish hemsworth?
Bot: Sort of haha Just a weird mixture of his face and Chris Hemsworth It was pretty well edited actually haha And it worked too. He got loads of messages

User: Its actually super easy. I took a basic computer graphics class in high school and swapping faces isnt that hard Especially if the skin tone is close To do it spot on is impressive though
Bot: The skin tone was not close at all haha, it was a bit tricky What is your favorite color?

User: Blue all the way. My eyes are blue so thats what i went with as a kid
Bot: I like blue too

User: Is it your favorite though?
Bot: But also a deep burgundy is nice Dark blue and burgundy are probably tied My eyes are blue too

User: Aye sweet! I love it. They change shades too because of rayliegh scattering which is awesome
Bot: Interesting

User: All blue eyes do that though
Bot: Really?

User: Yup. So people with brown eyes have brown eyes because of melanin which dyes them brown. But blue eyes have no pigment and are really an ugly gray. But because of the physical structure of our eyes, the only color that reflects is blue So if the structure changes a bit, so does the color
Bot: Haha mine are super light and look grey most of the time That's pretty interesting

User: I think i learned that from V Sauce so go you tube
Bot: Party. Gotta love youtube Do you have any classes for the rest of today?

User: Youtube and khan academy are clutch.
Bot: True

User: Nope, im doing some homework What about you?
Bot: Yep. Not looking forward to it

User: What do you have left?
Bot: And I have a whole paper to write before midnight Nutrition

User: RIP. Nutrition doesnt sound awful though
Bot: My teacher isn't the best

User: That'll do it. What are you majoring in?
Bot: Nursing You?

User: Electrical engineering
Bot: That's pretty cool

User: So is nursing. Do want to do anything in specific like nurse anesthetist?
Bot: The end goal is OB/GYN nurse practitioner. It's better than going to PA school, because I can work as an RN through school

User: That makes sense. I could not do OB/GYN. It would freak me out if anything went wrong
Bot: That's what all the practice is for haha

User: Ill stick with being an engineer where i can make stuff to prevent problems instead of saving people from them
Bot: I'm gonna work in Labor and Delivery as an RN for a few years, start working on my NP, etc I'd like to see you design something to prevent giving birth haha

User: Okay point taken. But my issue wouldnt be the actual delivery, so long as literally nothing went wrong.
Bot: What kind of problems would you solve?

User: So what is the difference between an OB/GYN nurse practitioner and a labor and delivery nurse?
Bot: A nurse practitioner can operate independently. An RN works under a doctor

User: Okay
Bot: Yeah. What is your dream job?

User: I like all of the third world projects. I saw one engineering group build a gravity light for that Working for space X and tesla all the way
Bot: Oh cool I want a Tesla

User: I want a tesla too
Bot: Nice.

User: They made a semi truck that goes not to 60 in 3 seconds! Thats mental! Wait, it was 5 seconds
Bot: Wow! That's crazy

User: Still mental though!
Bot: Yeah

User: So what other classes are you taking?
Bot: Chem, music, book of Mormon, human development You?

User: Calc, chem, BoM, EcEn, CS, and Writing
Bot: Oh cool. Freshman?

User: Yeah, right out of high school What about you?
Bot: I was here for summer, but still a freshman

User: How was summer semester? Pretty chill?
Bot: Yeah, like 15 students in every class

User: That sounds nice, i wont be able to take a summer semester for ages though
Bot: Why?

User: Im planning on going on a mission after this year Sometime in july maybe
Bot: Oh fun I'm thinking about a mission Are you a guy?

User: Yup, a mission has never really been a thinking abiut it area for me :)
Bot: Oh cool

User: What are you thinking now? Yea or nay?
Bot: Not sure. It's a big decision, and I need to figure out where I'm needed Why did you decide to go to a year of school first if you knew for sure you wanted to serve a mission?

User: Are you a girl?
Bot: You betcha

User: I figured Guys dont ever talk about missions like that here. Its either your all in or your not Or you tell people one or the other to shut them up Where would you want to go?
Bot: So why did you decide to go to a year of school first if you are so sure? A third world country

User: I wanted to have a true freshman experience you know?  I didnt recieve any feelings that i needed to go now, so i went to school first
Bot: Cool cool Where do you want to go?

User: My top two are Japan or england. South africa would be cool too China would be crazy as well
Bot: There aren't missions in China But Taiwan has some haha

User: Thats why china would be crazy Id be one of the first My young mens leader went to taiwan and he loved it
Bot: My friend is in Taiwan Yeah it would be cool Especially since they keep such detailed records

User: What do you mean?
Bot: They have ancestory records that date back to the 500s. Once China opens, there will be so much temple work to do It'll be great

User: Dang thats a lot of baptisms to do
Bot: Yep. A lot of ordinances

User: Do you know if the chinese members are allowed to leave to do work for chinese citizens?
Bot: I don't know. But a girl in my ward has access to her family history and goes 3 times a week to do baptisns

User: Thats cool. I havent gone since i got here. I think im going this weekend. Do you go often?
Bot: Yep every week

User: Which one do you go to? Provo or provo city center?
Bot: Both Mostly city center though

User: I love city center, its a beautiful building
Bot: It really is Where are you from?

User: Right outside of cincinnatie Ohio, a town called Amelia What about you? Cincinnati*
Bot: Bangor, Wales It's in Gywnedd, Northwest Wales

User: That means nothing to me but thats super cool Are you welsh? Welsh people are from wales right?
Bot: Yes haha

User: Do you speak welsh?
Bot: Indeed

User: Was it your first language?
Bot: Both were introduced to me at birth.

User: Thats awesome, i wish i was bilingual
Bot: It's not very handy here haha I speak English better probably

User: Unless you want to mess with someone ;) Is it weird coming to america? Like how different is the slang or the culture?
Bot: It's true haha, I could talk about someone secretly Absolutely. No one says "make out" at home. Haha

User: They dont use the words or they dont talk about it?
Bot: No we say snog And cany instead  of can't And everyone is fat

User: I knew about snog but cany? As in "i cany reach"?! Wait, everyone in america is fat or everyone in wales is fat?
Bot: Not saying I'm the world's most trim girl, but seriously

User: Im gonna assume trim means thin But you didnt answer the question. Wales is fat or america is fat?
Bot: You there?

User: Yeah Im still intrigued about if wales is fat or america is fat though
Bot: America is fat lol Sorry I didn't get any messages for a while

User: I was expecting that, i was kinda hoping it was the other way around though Its cool
Bot: Yes trim means thin. And yes. Like I cany understand. Haha why were you hoping Wales was generally overweight?

User: Not that wales was overweight but that someone thought america wasnt
Bot: Oh haha

User: To be fair most people on campus are pretty fit
Bot: Everyone thinks America is fat Haha No offense

User: Its not that bad! We have tons of athletic people
Bot: That is still how we all perceive it

User: Like michael phelps
Bot: True But that is the Olympics

User: So thats all we get? The fat country?
Bot: Don't forget that's where the Kardashians are from And New York

User: The kardashians are not a plus of america. New york is though
Bot: That's an association we all have Did you enjoy "high school"

User: Yeah i enjoyed "high school" what do you call it? And did you?
Bot: Secondary school Good old Ysgol Tryfan

User: Is that the name of the school or secondary school in welsh?
Bot: Top rated secondary school in Bangor The name of the school

User: I looked up a map of bangor, are there really that many schools there?
Bot: There are two secondary schools... But ours is the best

User: Hahahaha sounds a little biased
Bot: It's billingual, and had a great jazz band. I played the saxophone and we traveled to Paris Very biased

User: Is the other welsh school not bilingual?
Bot: Nope

User: That seems dumb
Bot: Which is why we win

User: I guess so, the other stuff is pretty standard though
Bot: Although Ysgol Tryfan used to be a girls grammar school. So there were 4 girls to every boy

User: Did you like that? Less idiot boys and all that
Bot: Well some boys were rather nice, but I hardly got a chance at them before he was mobbed by skeevy girls I did have a lot of girl friends though, so that was nice

User: Thats cool
Bot: A few guys, but never ones I was keen on

User: The way you structure your sentences is messing with me Not that its bad, just different
Bot: How so? Shall I dumb them down for you? Haha, be a proper Yankee? Just joking :)

User: Like in america we would say this "some of the guys were cool but i couldnt talk to them before all of the (insert bad word here) asked him out. " It just seems like you rearrange some of the words differently Hey, whos to say american english isnt superior?
Bot: Me

User: Well you would be sadly mistaken ;)
Bot: Haha What word would Americans use instead of skeevy?

User: I think whore is the only one thats not a swear word
Bot: Please educate me on Yankee slang Haha

User: Normally people would use the B word
Bot: I've heard slut before

User: True
Bot: Oh and ho. Hoe? How do you spell it?

User: Well here you just said f/!=er so....
Bot: They've really dramatized it Not in Wales!

User: Okay i believe you Now onto american slang. Do you know what clutch means?
Bot: Haha I'm a good member of the church, I wouldn't curse I don't know what that means

User: Its an adjective, from coming in clutch Like that really helped out
Bot: Like in a car?

User: That may be where it came from but it diesnt relate
Bot: I don't understand Haha Now you'll think I'm daft

User: So  if you are about to fall off of a cliff and someone saves you.  They were clutch

Bot: That sounds profane

User: So does tosser How about tight? That doesnt sound bad at all
Bot: Tight? Cool?

User: As in "we're tight"
Bot: Oh I have heard, "that's tight"

User: We're tight is like saying we're close. Thats tight is saying thats cool
Bot: Confusing haha

User: The place i live is pretty flat, but its really nice. There are forests everywhere. No matter where you go you can see deer on the side of the road if you wait long enough. When it rains it get cool and you can just stand in the rain or watch the rivers run through the streets
Bot: Oh cool

User: The city is much bigger. Its a labrynth of bypasses and skyscrapers running along the edge of the ohio river in thr foothills. Its super cool to see tower on top of giant hill
Bot: Oh cool That sounds very pretty

User: There is a place called newport on the levee that you can go to and at night you can see the entire skyline twinkling like stars It is. If you want to see the skyline just google cincinnati from newport
Bot: Ok

User: Do you have different music in europe?
Bot: That's very lovely Yes, weird pop music that was filthy.  So mostly jazz

User: Do you like the american music you've heard?
Bot: Most of it Country is repulsive

User: That is a given No one should like country I listen to indie rock and alt rock most of the time
Bot: Agreed. It is primitive and tosh

User: Have you heard the lumineers?
Bot: No, I take it they are American?

User: Yeah they are really good How about maroon 5?
Bot: Yea Those were popular to play at formals

User: Yeah i can see that Lets see, mumford and sons is british i think, how about the killers?
Bot: American?

User: Yes, but extremely good. They sing mr brightside How about Panic at the Disco or Fall Out Boy? They are pretty big here
Bot: Yes the gothics listen to those haha I like Mr. Bluesky

User: Mr bluesky is a different song from Mr Brightsidw Its pretty good too though
Bot: I know haha, but the similarities reminded me

User: Mr. Brightside is a little darker than that
Bot: I haven't heard it

User: But not super emo
Bot: Ah interesting I've some homework to do. Perhaps we can talk later?

User: Not unless we swap info This thing is random Whatever you feel like is cool with me
Bot: If you don't end the chat, it'll be fine Right?

User: Yeah i guess so, it'll have to end eventually though.
Bot: Alright then.

User: Ill leave it open for now though
Bot: Sounds fine

User: My TED Talk would be about robots That's all I got. haha
Bot: What do you want?

User: If the internet just stopped working, I believe there would be a lot of confusion and chaos in the first moments-even going into a few months!
Bot: I think I've gotten this prompt before I think the biggest thing is that the stock market would just plummet

User: Logged into this chat room... I live life on the edge...
Bot: Wow, that's a loaded question! One time I've pulled an all nighter 3 days in a row haha! That was pretty crazy I also served a 2 year mission, that was pretty crazy What have you done Josh?

User: what do you count as pets
Bot: I would honestly say any animals could be considered pets.  like I could totally have a pet alligator if i wanted too

User: okay interestin do you think people would just stop eating meat then because it's pretty sick to eat something that's talking to you
Bot: Oooh yeah thats a good point I'm sure there would be a lot more vegetarians then

User: aww man that would suck because I'm a big steak girl
Bot: Oh yeah, I love my fried chicken and my bacon

User: ugHHHH yes why is fried chicken so good liek it's almost unfair how good it is
Bot: I know!!! Like colonel sanders really knew what secret herbs and spices to use when making his chicken

User: YESSS now all i can think about is getting fried chicken for dinner man
Bot: Haha.  That sounds delicious!!! You should send some to meee

User: girl i'll give you the HOOOOK UP jk haha i might just settle for grocery store fried chicken though LOL
Bot: Well any fried chicken is better then no fried chicken lol XD

User: LOL TRUW it's been so long since i've had fried chicken it's insane!
Bot: Me tooo. Do you have afavorite place to get fried chicken??

User: oh hmmmm I grew on Popeye's but there aren't that many nearby so I've settled for KFC now oh but lemme tell ya I'm also Filipino and we have a fried chicken chain that serves up the BEST fried chicken I've ever had in my entire life
Bot: ooh what is it called

User: Ohhhh no. Nope. Nooooope. I could not do that. It is probably the food I dislike most. I would help colonize the moon. Cheese, right?
Bot: Haha Peanut butter would be such a mess. Maybe if the ocean was milk and the mountains were chocolate and I could mix in a banana in then I could make a smoothie out of the earths elements

User: Now that would be delightful. It'd be too dense to walk through too I'm getting the feeling that you're the person at the top of the leader board.
Bot: Could you imagine surfing on it.  It would have to be creamy peanut butter or it would hurt The first time you fell off the surf board you would  stuck.

User: Hahaha. If you had a lot of momentum that sudden stop could do quite some damage.
Bot: My sister loves everything peanut butter.  I think I dislike it because every treat she makes always has peanut butter on it

User: I don't mind Reeses or peanut butter cookies... it's weird. But something about just straight peanut butter is so....ohhh man, I'm gagging just thinking of it.
Bot: Haha.  Ya.  Its such an unrealistic concept.  Maybe Star Trek could do a movie on encountering a world like that and the challenges

User: What kind of people would live there?
Bot: Haha.  What if you lived on that world and you were allergic to peanuts.  Game over!

User: I swear I can smell peanut butter right now. This is disgusting. Oh that would be terrible!
Bot: Probably little marshmallow people.  Marshmallows go okay with peanut butter and chocolate

User: I wouldn't know. Would they be peaceable creatures?
Bot: I think they would have to be insane creatures.  Living in peanut butter!  How could anyone be sane or normal

User: That is true. But also, who would even have the capabilities to create that much peanut butter??
Bot: Good point! You would have to have some place to grow the peanuts first.  Peanuts dont grow in peanut butter

User: Peanuts grow on bushes, right? I don't think I've just ever happened upon wild peanuts.
Bot: And where would they grind it into peanut butter.  And when they shelled them, where do all the shells go You raise some really good issues

User: Right? You'd have to create a whole OTHER separate planet just for the peanut shells. It doesn't make sense. Efficiency is so vital to creation.
Bot: Have you ever left the country and had to get a peanut butter shot.  So if you lived on a peanut butter world, would you have to have a peanut butter shot to go to another planet?

User: I've been lucky that the international locations to which I've gone to, I have not had to receive one of those nasty shots :/ But wow....very valid point. Also...currency. What would it be??
Bot: I think they would give jelly shots

User: I literally can smell all of this. I am dying.
Bot: What if the flying pigs lived in a peanut butter world.  We would have peanut butter flavored bacon. Yuck!!

User: Why taint such a beautiful creation with peanut butter?? *shudder*
Bot: haha.  Ya the peanut butter image is just a twisted one no matter what picture we put it in

User: So are you admitting that you possibly are not a peanut butter lover?
Bot: Yes.  Sort of.  I think its because my sister puts it on everything and tries to get me to eat it. Oddly, I love a peanut butter and jelly or honey sandwich once and a while.  With a tall glass of milk.

User: Gaaaaggggg One time I tried almond butter to see if I could survive that? Nope. Any kind of nut that is creamed is just weird.
Bot: Oh.

User: But that is just my humble opinion. And I judge not those that love it.
Bot: I have an interesting story about a friend mistakenly trying sunflower peanut butter and did not know he was allergic to sunflowers.

User: Oh that is mighty unfortunate. What a way to find out, though, right? Also, I was ignorant to the fact that existed. You learn something new every day.
Bot: His tongue started going numb.  Then his chest got hard to breath.  We were at a national scout camp with 45,000 other scouts.  In the end, he got to ride in a humvee and was attended to by some cute nurses.  It was not comfortable and a little life threatening but he loved the attention and tried hard to get the nurses to give him more attention

User: Well, that is quite the story. I mean, scout camp is a good place to be because a lot of trained and certified men are there haha. Also, did you hear today that the Church is officially pulling out of the BSA program at the end of 2018?
Bot: I did just get a text about that.  It is sad.  I am an Eagle scout and learned a lot from scouting that is valuable in my life I think it was inevitable It is going to be interesting to see what the church chooses to replace the "activity arm of the Young Men." What are your thoughts on the announcement?

User: I am the only girl in my family, and was raised with 3 brothers who loved scouts (well the younger one not so much haha) So I am a bit sad my boys would have that experience. BUT I do know that the Church is implementing a new program for the youth in general (it was announced in the same announcement). But nothing is the same as the life skills you learn as a Scout! And being an Eagle Scout gives you an upper hand in interviews, applications, etc., so now what will Young Men have to put on their resumes that's respected and widely known?
Bot: I wonder if the worlds perception of the value of an Eagle Scout accomplishment will change though

User: I mean, it should, in my opinion. If the Church, the biggest financial contributor to the program, backs out then I believe the world should notice and adapt as well to what our boys will bring to the table instead. But, I'm also not a boy scout haha so I'm not sure.
Bot: One of the goals of the Boy Scout organization was to try and expand the experiences to both boys and girls.  I liked that idea and agree in this day and age both young men women can benefit from the skills that can be developed I guess the issue is the supervision and how the church views interaction between young men and young women verses the world

User: My question with that idea of expansion is that....there's already a Girls Scout program. Why don't they just reestablish how to make it more respectable and approachable, instead of encroaching on the BSA program? I understand, equality and feminism and all, I mean, I'm a feminist in the sense that we deserve just as much as the guys do, but still. Something already existed for them.
Bot: The problem was that the Girls Scout program was not getting the same community financial support and never really developed.  Companies would only give donations to one and then thought they were through I had an eye opening experience when I went to the world scout jamboree in Denmark Sweden and there were boys and girls tenting together.  That just did not fit the scouting program and values I knew.

User: First off, Denmark. That's legit. Second off, I totally believe that would be disheartening. That breaks my heart. It is becoming so hard for us to exist in the world but not partake of the world. But as established in the other chat, we like a good challenge :)
Bot: yes. we do.  Who is on the Lord's side who?  We are.  Could not picture any other side to be on

User: Me neither. It'd be terrifying frankly, because we know how it's going to end. I just want to scoop everyone up and bring them to safety.
Bot: That is the natural fruit of the tree of life -- to turn and be concerned about the welfare of others and them  finding their way.

User: I couldn't agree more.
Bot: How far did we get off this original topic.  Funny how conversations can branch.

User: Hello? How are you?
Bot: Hello!

User: Still cant see anything.
Bot: Doing good You? Hello?

User: Yeah t isnt working again. Oh hey whats up!
Bot: It works now?

User: Can you see my chats?
Bot: Yes And I'm doing pretty good You?

User: I cant see your chats until i refresh. I am doing rather well.
Bot: Good, do we need to try a new chat if this one isn't working for you?

User: Hello?
Bot: whats up hello?

User: yeah, sorry. more computer spazzes
Bot: thats good haha

User: Have you seen Infinity War yet?
Bot: no i have not

User: are you a marvel person?
Bot: i am, meaning i love their movies, but i dont have any comics or anything

User: OK, so you plan on seeing at some point in the future? If not, I am hardcore advising you to go see it soon
Bot: yeah i need to i will probably wait for to come out on dvd since i hear that is will be soon

User: True. See a movie and save money. Good move. My dad was too hyped to wait for that
Bot: yeah? is he a big fan?

User: Oh yeah. He's that one guy who cheers in the movie theater.
Bot: hahaha that is hilarious

User: Part of the time, I'm sitting next to him and pretending I don't know him. But the majority of the time, I'm cheering with him. It's a problem.
Bot: yeah i would imagine have you ever been asked to leave or do you just get eyerolls i guess you wouldnt be able to tell if people were rolling their eyes in the dark hahaha

User: . .
Bot: hello?

User: Hello!
Bot: cool You again. Maybe we can both make double the progress. :) We seem to be the only two people on

User: lol feels like it, but that's ok XD
Bot: Oh  you killed our other window.  Thats ok. So did you see the topic about whether it is murder if you close down a computer

User: lol thought that was the on you exed out XD srry lol yeah i think its kind of dumb
Bot: I thought it was dumb too. Some of these topics are way off the wall. Like a peanut butter world.  Really?!

User: haha hey that one is legit
Bot: haha.  I have had some crazy discussions on that subject.

User: like what?
Bot: If unicorns are real was really hard until I was talking with someone who knew how to get that subject to an interesting one

User: how did they make that one interesting?
Bot: We said that a unicorn is a normal horse and he magic was in the horn then we concluded that the magic horn must have the ability to grant wishes And then we started asking what we would wish for

User: oh dude i think that was me XD
Bot: oh.  you are awesome.  It was probably you.  We have talked a couple times and I am always happy to talk to you I am blown away that you can come up with great dialogue while you are sitting in class at school. So you are doing this all on your phone?

User: haha yeah we've had a lot of interesting conversations. government, computers, seeing eachother in classes, unicorns, peanut butter etc. and nope i have a school provided chrome book that im doing this on
Bot: right.  Yes we have.

User: are you on your phone or a computer?
Bot: Thats cool.  You got some mad skills.  You gotta come to BYU!  we need people like you. :-) remember yesterday at this time I was trying out my phone (voice to text). I will admit I was driving and walking around doing errands.  So my dialogue probably was disjointed.

User: haha yeah mad skills at typing on multiple windows XD
Bot: We have talked when I had multiple windows open (trying that out)

User: lol yeah i do remember it
Bot: More than three windows and I was a mental mess

User: yeah i have 5 up right now and its a struggle
Bot: Ok.  I am going to close another of ours.

User: my brain is compartmentalizing all these convos and at this point i think you're like 4 different people XD
Bot: haha. You have had multiple conversations with me and I thought the same of you

User: lol well then you're ahead, i just respond to whoever answers when i have that many up and forget who im talking to. but you generally say really funny stuff so i remember you XD
Bot: How do you have 5 conversations going (several with me) and you are in class.  You really do have mad skills Haha. sometimes I go with the conversation any way it goes.

User: lol mad skills like you said XD and im crocheting at the same time
Bot: lol.  you are killing me.

User: haha why you jelly?
Bot: That would be quite the scene.

User: haha the girl next to me is like ________ how are you doing all this? and im like *shrugs* what are yo doing?
Bot: my mother is talking to me on my phone about my brother

User: lol so you're talking on the phone and chatting?
Bot: She just told me she found disappointing dialogue on his phone between him and a girl She is really upset with the pictures she found.  He has been sneaking around with this girl (not a member) the girl is really trying to tempt him and he is giving in.  His school work is going down hill fast

User: oh no that's not good! what is she going to do about it?
Bot: I dont know.  She wonders if taking away his phone and other priviledges will be successful

User: has she talked about him why that's not ok yet? a lot of the time my dad with us starts with explaining why something is wrong and then punishes us so the next time we have the logic and not just the memory of the pain the punishment bring
Bot: yes. both her and my dad.  I guess we all thought he was doing okay and now my mom found stuff on his phone suggesting he has been artfully deceiving everyone sounds like my dad

User: yeah he kind of sounds like my brother a bit, how old is he?
Bot: 15

User: yup same age as one of my brothers
Bot: so he should not be dating.  thats our family rule that we all have abided by

User: yeah same
Bot: well my sister tested the limits a little.  but generally followed all the rules

User: that's too bad, i know how that feels though. cause you're older and so you know how the decisions will affect him in the long run and you're like nooo don't do it!! at least thats how it is for me
Bot: he is a great brother is so many ways.  I will be really sad if he misses out on a mission.

User: yeah that would be really sad :(
Bot: I think its really cool that you are going.  My sister loved hers and it was great experience for her and led to finding her husband

User: yeah im really excited! what was the favorite part on yours?
Bot: In nebraska? I just like sharing the gospel

User: did you have a favorite lesson you liked to teach?
Bot: I guess I could have gone anywhere and loved it

User: what was your favorite lesson to teach?
Bot: the restoration.  really I liked them all.  I liked going with what the spirit prompted

User: yeah thats a good one, i really like the plan of salvation
Bot: Often I was learning too.  that is probably what I loved most.

User: did you get to baptize anyone while you were serving?
Bot: yes.  It did not matter to me if I baptized them or someone else did.  I was happy because they were happy

User: that's sweet :) im really excited to be able to share what changed my life *changes
Bot: can you share it with me or remind me

User: just the gospel in general changes my life, i wouldn't know who i am and i would be lost without it. it always has been and still is the best thing ive been given.
Bot: that is a broad statement.  what specifically do you have a testimony of? I think its kind of like we all have a bag for testimony marbles when we go on our mission we usually only have a few marbles and think that it may not be enough to be a missionary. but if we testify on those marbles that we have, we are given more.  my marbles multiplied ten fold in two years of full time service to the Lord.

User: nope just give me a sec
Bot: I need to jump.  Lets keep up the conversation on a different chat and machine thanx.

User: Hey there
Bot: hi!

User: how are you
Bot: Doing good, how are you?

User: Pretty good. have you seen any good movies lately?
Bot: Yeah actually!

User: Tell me more!
Bot: I just went and saw the new Wes Anderson movie, Isle of Dogs over the weekend

User: Me too! What was your favorite part?
Bot: Oh man, hard to chose One of my favorites though was when the exchange student was debriefing about all the characters What about you! *?

User: Lots of people would try to send Learning suite messages to their professors.
Bot: I already do that! Thats just the life here at BYU Happy Halloween! I think if the internet were to stop working, I would definitely quit my major of being a computer science major. Mainly because that would soon be obsolete Then there would be a world-wide anarchy, besides maybe 3rd world countries, where things would be nearly the same as they are now.

User: oh hi sorry I was programming
Bot: haha, its all good Dang you're a programmer too! What language

User: It was a little buggy, but I got 1 hundred points. The bugs were easy to fix.
Bot: Please don't say C++

User: Spanish.
Bot: Oh, thats interesting. Is that one of those high level programming languages Oh, thats sweet that you got all the bugs to be fixed.

User: Yeah, it's really quick Oh, yeah. It works well. Zybooks gave me some trouble, but it wasn't as bad as other times.
Bot: I think I like programming, but its not necessarily the best thing in the world. I think there are definitely better and more fun things to do Like designing stuff on the computer! Although, when you combine them you get the best of both worlds Thats why I think programs today are so awesome! They are beginning to implement more design into them. I can remember the time when designers drew on paper, and programmers

User: I don't know What have you done/
Bot: Hello Um The craziest thing that I have done is probably go explore an abandoned asylum Whats is the funnest thing you have done?

User: Oh hey Wow. How did you end up doing that?
Bot: Going to the asylum?

User: Yeah I can't think of the funnest thing I've done. Hmmm.
Bot: I like photography and I had heard about it and was really wanting the grunge look So we went and got a few good shots

User: Cool. Kind of scary though.
Bot: Oh it was terrifying I wont do that again

User: Yeah, I bet! I'd be terrified.
Bot: ten out of ten worth it though At least for the pictures

User: That's the sacrifice for good art. ;)
Bot: Hahaha What is something you have always wanted to do but never gotten around to it

User: I want to be better at piano
Bot: Do you already play? I assume since you said you want to be better

User: Yeah, I play a little, but not much.
Bot: How many years have you done it so far?

User: I did it when I was little. For like five years. But, kind of off and on.
Bot: Oh thats cool What other things do you like to do?

User: I like to read.
Bot: How often do you make it to a new book?

User: Not very often, unfortunately. But, I want to read one or two a week. Just have other things...
Bot: That makes sense A lot of things that I want to do are often pushed aside

User: Right. I want to add it more to my life though.
Bot: What kind of genre is your favorite to read about

User: I like fantasy and self improvement books. Do you like to read? What books do you like?
Bot: Its one of those things that I say I like but never get around to.... Haha I would love to have a library

User: Right! Me too
Bot: Really anything nonfiction is fun to me

User: That is fun. I do like those.
Bot: Do you keep up with any TV shows

User: Yeah. Some
Bot: Which ones do you keep up with?

User: I've been watching the Good Place You?
Bot: My sister watches that! She really wants me to start I have heard good things about it I watch Brooklyn 99

User: I really like it. I do too.
Bot: You do!? How do you like it?

User: Yeah. Watched some last night. It's funny. The same writers who made that show also made the Good Place.
Bot: Ill start the good place once this season of brooklyn 99 is over

User: Good. It's on Netflix. But only the first season. I'm waiting for the second one to come to Netflix because I don't want to buy it. Well, I've got to go. Talk to you later!
Bot: It has been good talking Have a great evening

User: Nothing That about sums up my life I I'd be game to read minds
Bot: hello. I'm sure the people running this appreciate your spam. This thing said it would notify me when people join but it hasn't been! So it leads to conversations like this where I am gone for the first long part of it until magically reappearing later.

User: I love the smell of the ocean. Especially after it rains. But not near the red seaweed. That stuff's nasty.
Bot: That's pretty cool. I would love that smell too. I love the smell of trees blossoming. And just most flowers in general. I especially love walking on campus and smelling the trees as we walk around.

User: Hi there!
Bot: Hii!!! What's up???

User: I would make everyone take the day off go home and have a party.
Bot: Yes! Great idea! I would probably accidentally do something stupid and mess up a lot of laws.

User: Same whats one law you would change? Speed Limits
Bot: This is a really random law, but I would make a law where parents have to decide at their kids birth if they are an organ donor. So that they don't have to decide when their kid is brain dead... I've been watching too much greys anatomy... Speed limits are good to though! A little less morbid lol *too

User: hello?
Bot: Hi? I am with Kaela Nelson. She says she knows you.  Unless you are a different Matt Nielsen

User: haha i might be where does she know me from?
Bot: She says you are in your home ward

User: haha nope probably not me im from virginia
Bot: Not you then. What are you studying?

User: The world would be amazing...for about three days
Bot: All the people with peanut allergies would die! Hey! Hello?

User: I think their conversation would be in binary. So I guess that would be fun for them, but boring for everyone else.
Bot: Oh, thats a good point, it might be binary. They would read it better than probably any of us! Haha

User: visit temples across the globe
Bot: Hey whats up!

User: Hi! I think we might be two of the only people online rn
Bot: I am talking to one other person but i think he is getting off

User: wow. i guess midnight really is an hour of sleep
Bot: Yeah everyone is asleep Its like they actually have a curfew or something Hey guys this is college!

User: except us apparently, and yeah! what a strange phenomenon and don't some buildings have a curfew
Bot: I guess Liberty doesnt And they dont enforce one at helaman halls and that is on campus So i dont know where they would

User: Oh okay. I've known people to get locked out by sneaking out or things like that
Bot: Oh yeah it locks up You can get in with your id card though no biggie

User: They also tried to get out of their apartment, but couldn't for the longest time because someone was pacing in the hallway. Now that i think about it, this mightve been an efy thing
Bot: Yeah they do that in efy all the time I went to efy like 5 times

User: my sister is actually going up to provo for efy in june or july I've only gone twice I wanted to go again this year
Bot: Really? That is fun. I went to byu for efy twoce and i really enoyed it I also went to Provo once and it was really fun to I also went to Provo once and it was really fun to

User: i went to provo in 2015 i think, and then independence mo last year independence was great because it was a special edition
Bot: I think i went to provo in 2015 too but it was my last year

User: really?
Bot: Yeah I am 21 now. I should be a counselor or something!

User: dang! maybe you know my other sister. she was actually in the older group It would be fun! and i think they pay you! wait. i forgot they did multiple weeks lol
Bot: Yeah and they have multiple groups how old is your soster?

User: she is 20 now.
Bot: Oh ok. Yep still younger than me, but i guess a possibility

User: yeah. she could have been in your group. unlikely, but possible lol
Bot: Yeah definitely unlikely, But still what a small world

User: Right? There are so many people that you could have met earlier than you did, but one small choice could've changed that
Bot: um wools Woops Just closed the other chat on accident

User: It's okay! That's good to know though
Bot: Do you have a laptop?

User: yeah. I'm using it right now
Bot: That is sooooo helpful I wish i had one

User: My parents got me this one so I could work on school, because I went to a mainly online high school And you are getting pretty close to getting something like a laptop i think I actually don't know what a macbook pro is..
Bot: Wait did you say something? If you did it disappeared

User: yeah i can send them again if you want
Bot: Oh ok yeah

User: My parents got me this one so i could work on school, since I went to a mainly online school
Bot: Oh that is interesting what type is it?

User: and you are getting pretty close to getting something like a laptop I think, but idk what a macbook pro is and it is a lenovo brand
Bot: Oh that is nice

User: it has a detachable keyboard
Bot: You dont know what a macbook pro is?

User: not really...
Bot: Go to apple.com And find a macbook pro It is a really nice laptop Compact and high performance

User: okay, i figured it was a laptop because macBOOK, and books can close I'm not a huge apple person or at least my dad never buys apple stuff
Bot: Yeah my dad didnt use to either But my family is slowly becoming addicted They are really good at refining technology and making it pleasing to the eye and a snap to use. I use an iphone and i really like it a lot.

User: I really like the Black Panther Movie. It was impressive because of how well it was able to be a stand alone movie in the marvel universe.
Bot: I saw that too. It was a really good movie. The one made an impression on me was Your Name

User: When did you go?
Bot: I went to see it like 2-3 weeks ago

User: Oh wow, about the same as me. What was Your Name about? I don't remember seeing any trailers for it.
Bot: It is a japanese animation movie. I went to the international cinema showing. It is like one of the highest gross animation It is about how to people switch bodies

User: huh, that's interesting. So it was multiple people who switched bodies for a period of time or was it just two people?
Bot: just two people but then the girl discovered that it ran in the family

User: so it was like a reoccurring thing that the family had to deal with.
Bot: ya. If I give out to much information it will ruin the movie very interesting plot twists here is link about it on rotten tomatoes https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/your_name_2017/

User: Haha, well now I'm interested. When I have time after finals I'll take a look. Do you speak Japanese or just watch it with subtitles?
Bot: I wish I spoke Japanese.  I just watched it with subtitles. Do you speak another language?

User: I speak Chinese. So it's fun to watch their movies sometimes, but they speak really fast, have strong accents, and say things that I don't understand sometimes so it is hard to watch. I still prefer to watch with English subtitles.
Bot: Oh. Did you serve a Chinese-speaking misson?

User: Yes I did. I went to Taiwan. I just got back last December.
Bot: did you go to Taipei or Taichuan

User: taichung
Bot: Cool I have friends who served there

User: Lots!!! I can't pick one
Bot: That's cool. Just a two person chat? first time

User: Hi there How are you doing today? Enjoying the weekend at all?
Bot: Hello again Hello? Can you read my messages, oh there they are Yeah I am and you?

User: Hello!
Bot: Hey! Fancy meeting you here.

User: Hows that optimal control project going?
Bot: It's going.

User: How have you applied optimal control in your own life?
Bot: By finding the optimal amount of free food. It is like second nature to me. What about you? :)

User: Which club has the most free food?
Bot: ACME was supposed to have infinite pizza... but it has been kind of disappointing. They also said there would be infinite cake! But I guess if we make infinite money in our salaries over infinite time, then we can buy infinite pizza and infinite cake. Do you agree?

User: But the optimal option to eat infinite cake is to eat it all right now. So is it really optimal if we won't get funded infinite cake **and kolaches** right now?
Bot: That depends on the choice of objective function. But what is the optimal objective function?

User: Mine is optimizing current utils of happiness, with a restraint term on happiness on the future
Bot: So then is maximizing happiness an unbounded optimization problem or is it a constrained optimization problem? Is it convex? Does it have a global optimum?

User: No. How can a robot feel the same complex feelings that a human being can feel? I guess we're supposed to be talking about computer not  robots.
Bot: I agree Robot's don't have brains so they can't feel emotions

User: I feel like cat fishing is more of a concept of luring someone than a solid definition, so I would say a computer could catfish you into something.
Bot: wow your message arrived before the prompt did so, is there anyone on the other end this time? welp, nice chatting!

User: Hey how is it going today?
Bot: It's finally Friday which is the best! I had 2 midterms to take today though which wasn't the best.

User: YES! I'm so excited for the weekend. I feel like all my Friday classes are bum because my mind is already somewhere else! haah Oh man sorry to hear that! Which two midterms did you have to take today? I had three last week and one this week so I know how you feel!
Bot: One for my civilization class, and one for my abnormal psychology class. What is one of your favorite classes this semester?

User: Oh awesome that abnormal psychology class sounds pretty interesting! I took a civilization class in the spring...worst class ever! haha how are you liking int? it* My favorite class would probably have to be my anatomy class! Its really cool learning all about the body and how it functions! You?
Bot: It's been great! My husband took anatomy a couple years ago and he really liked it

User: Well hey there!
Bot: Hello! How are you?

User: How's your day going? I'm doing great
Bot: Good, glad to hear it. The weather lately has been incredible

User: Agreed! I took my dog on a walk today and it was beautiful outside
Bot: You have a dog?! What kind?

User: A Welsh Corgi. Her name is Nova. She's adorable
Bot: Wow, I bet. I wish I had a dog. Someday I'll get one, hopefully soon. They're so much fun

User: I know right? I just got her last month. I've been wanting a dog for a while and I finally got my chance!
Bot: That's awesome! It's so hard to find housing in Provo that is pet friendly. You're almost guaranteed to pay super expensive rent. My wife and I are moving into new apartments this summer that are pet-friendly, so maybe that will be our chance!

User: That's awesome! They don't allow pets in our complex either but I have general anxiety so my husband and I arranged for a doctor to write as a prescription for an Emotional Support Animal so no expensive rent for us!
Bot: That's awesome! I love that you can do that. It's awesome that you can do that without any discrimination. Anxiety is hard enough Where did you get your dog?

User: We found her on KSL. Her old owners lived in Logan, UT
Bot: That's awesome. So you probably didn't have to train her as much as you might have to train a puppy.

User: Yeah she came fully trained. She's super smart and doesn't get into trouble. Plus she was already used to living in an apartment so that was nice.
Bot: That's so awesome. We've been looking into getting either a border collie, or an Australian Shepard

User: Those are amazing dogs!! My dog back home is a border collie. They are so smart and fun. Not super great for apartments though because they have so much energy haha. Unless they are exercised a ton of course
Bot: Yeah, that's the big downside. It's probably the biggest reason we haven't pulled the trigger yet. We want to make sure we can provide for all the dog's needs. It's pretty important

User: Yeah that's the hardest part of having a dog. Exercising them and being home enough is the hardest part for sure.
Bot: My wife graduates in April, so hopefully there will be more time between the two of us. It's sad to think that our dog would have to stay in a kennel or cage all day while I'm at school.

User: Yeah it's rough. Luckily our dog is really good so we don't have to keep her on her kennel, we just let her roam around the apartment. We try not to leave her too long though.
Bot: That's awesome. I've always wondered, do you think it's a lot like taking care of a baby or kid?

User: Giving them enough attention certainly is similar to having a kid but the fact that you can leave them alone for hours is quite different haha. It honestly depends on the dog. Ours is very low maintenance and sleeps all through the night in her kennel. She doesn't bark or whine or pee in our apartment so we're lucky. But some dogs (mainly the small yappy ones) are not as smart/loyal and cause a lot of problems for people.
Bot: That makes sense. My wife and I have friends that recently had a baby, and we get to take care of him from time to time. It's kind of amazing. I know everyone always jokes about women being "baby hungry," and my wife is no exception to that stereotype, but she's really starting to win me over! But, dog or baby, it isn't all breezy fun and games! There's a lot of responsibility involved, and lots of work. Well, I have to go! It's been nice chatting!

User: If unicorns were real I would hunt unicorns What a prize
Bot: If unicorns were real I would eat unicorns What a taste

User: Oh dang. Savage I don't know how to handle that
Bot: What- you wouldn't eat unicorn meat?

User: If I could relive one day I would go back to when Bitcoin was less than a cent and buy as much as I can and come back to this day and sell it all
Bot: I think I would relive any day I was enjoying by the ocean absorbing the uv rays lol thats really smart

User: thank you theres a few people on now
Bot: im in a chat with another girl

User: if you let them know that you are working on homework at the same time they might not leave chat
Bot: okay i did, i have two chats with two other people right now, i wonder who these kids are and where they come from and how they just happen to appear right when you open up ten chats and now youre not even building points for me loser

User: Oh man, I wish this was my case haha!
Bot: ...traveling the world, I guess?

User: But if money wasn't an object I would probably spend my money on traveling with my family to exotic places around the world and enjoying fine foods.
Bot: Exactly

User: Yeah, haha like what else are you supposed to do
Bot: Guess you could sensible and take as many college classes as you wanted? Or donate to charity?

User: Yeah dude if i had that much money I think I would probably drop out of college! haha And maybe find something to invest it so I don't run out of money. Donating to charity would be really awesome as well! I think it would be fun to set up service projects and take people to needy places!
Bot: You could make all the third world countries so much better supplied

User: Very true that would be a much better use of money than wasting it all on useless stuff. Although I think I would still go on lots of trips with my family.
Bot: Yeah, think of all the expensive things you could do! Five-star hotels, zip-lining, scuba diving, safaris, cruises, etc Skiiing in Switzerland and fancy chocolate in Germany

User: Oh dude that sounds so fun! I would go to tropical places and rent cool cars to drive around in. Get some private beach houses and resorts. Order room service for breakfast. haha If only.
Bot: Yes room service The epitome of wealth My mom would definitely buy her own private island. Like Gilligan's Island

User: Dude that would be so cool! buy your own island... If you bought your own island would you have it for like personal use or have like a beautiful vacation home and let people rent it out and stuff like that.
Bot: And make even more money! I think my mom is just fascinated by all they could do on island with such limited supplies. She wants to go native

User: Thats awesome your mom sounds like a really fun lady!
Bot: Well...she contradicts herself a lot...b/c she's also kind of a germaphobe

User: If I had a private Island I'd just take everything I've ever wanted and put it on there haha! A delicous sushi resteraunt! haha that is so funny! I swear moms are the most funny people in the world. like in middle school I was like no mom please don't come near me. But during highschool and after my mission Its super fun to hangout with my mom!
Bot: Heck yeah sushi! Haha I know. I now appreciate my mom so much more...b/c laundry...and cooking...

User: Oh man you're so right, I would do anything for some moms cooking haha! Cereal and peanut butter and jelly get kind of gross after a while! Sushi is my favorite! Do you have any favorite places to eat around provo? Or utah in general?
Bot: True that. I've actually had to stop buying PB b/c I kept spooning it...w/o the bread. Sad times Hm...I haven't gotten out a lot, but my sister took me to a place called Bonsai Sushi which was pretty good, and my roommate ordered from Five Brothers about 4 times last week

User: Oh man I've definitely had that problem before. I used to keep a jar of peanut butter on my desk and then I'd just leave the spoon in the jar haha. Kind of gross. It was so yummy thought! though* Oh nice I've been to five sushi bros a lot they have some pretty good sushi! Never been to Bonsai sushi I've heard of it! Is it any good?
Bot: Right? Something about PB is just plain good. So whenever that prompt comes up about "what would you do if the world was made of PB" I'm like...celebrate? Yeppers! I haven't had sushi for a while so it was just plain good.

User: haha YES I love how you know that that is one of the prompts. Some dude said we would all be greasy and I nearly died of laughter! Have you ever tried any other kinds of nut butters? Like cashew or almond butter? They are kind of pricey but super delicous!
Bot: Wow. Quality answer. Hm...don't think so...probably b/c of the price yeah. But I haven't even tried Nutella which makes me plenty ashamed already

User: DUDE you haven't even tried nutella? Me asking you that probably doesn't make you feel any better haha That stuff is so yummy! You'd love it, especially if you make like a nutella peanut butter sandwich...sooo good. Tastes almost like a reeses but not really, but its still yummy.
Bot: Ugh don't make me more sad. I'll try some! ...eventually... Nice reeses. Literally nuts and chocolate are literally a match made in heaven though

User: They are the best match ever. I will choose nuts and chocolate over any other candies anyday! Yes I'd give you a tub of nutella if I could. Everybody should have it! So how are classes and everything this semester?
Bot: Unless you're allergic...that could cause just a couple problems... Pretty good! Attempting to study for Bio, went over a BoM exam with my professor today, falling asleep in astronomy class...all the good stuff.

User: That's true. If you're allergic that would probably just be  a recipe for disaster. Classic. I feel like if anyclass would put you to sleep it would be astronomy. Do you guys get to go up into the little like star gazing thing up in the Eyering Science center
Bot: Yep. I have the class that's once a week, for 2.5 hours. No food, no drinks, no gum, darkness, warm room, reclining chairs. Now that's a recipe for disaster.

User: Dude if I was in that class as soon as I step in that room I would be out cold! haha is the stuff you learn interesting at all or boring?
Bot: Basically me. It's all really interesting! ...but my body is literally on power saving mode: if there's no movement I conk out The professor sometimes incorporates the religion aspect and then it's really mindblowing

User: haha totally me! So how are you doing on this contest for the cool prizes? Dude I can imagine. I feel like if you went in there and then started playing that one Hymn, If you could Hie to Kolob you would just be out of this world or something! haha
Bot: Pretty well? I keep getting a lot ghosts on here which is kind of weird but it's fine. Right? Literally my favorite song too. *hymn

User: Dude what are those ghost chats? I get those sometimes too and its just like a chat room but no one ever responds to my chats for like ever. Sometimes I'll talk to myself in those chats hahaaha Such a cool song! Okay I got a question for ya, What is your favorite way to waste time?
Bot: Is even possible to have a favorite method? I don't know...doing this, at the moment. Watching American Ninja Warrior videos. Ah, I gotta go to FHE.

User: haha
Bot: Nice chatting

User: hello
Bot: Hello? Hey jtpyron30!

User: what are you up to this fine evening
Bot: If pets could talk I wouldn't like my dog as much honestly.

User: hahaha

Bot: *her ehhh doubtful Not a very bright dog

User: smh friends i watched wall-e last night hahah
Bot: friends is the best

Bot: I watched that Beautiful minds movie

User: ayyyy what'd you think?
Bot: not bad, kind of weird though that he was seeing all those people

User: "kind of weird"
Bot: like even his roommate was imaginary that entire time.

User: yeah that's schizophrenia lol
Bot: He never actually had a roommate So he literally was insane, but brilliant at the same time.

User: yes sir a beautiful mind, but a sad, difficult one
Bot: Was that based on a real nobel prize winner?

User: yeah its very accurate from what i've read
Bot: oh cool!

User: I'm sure they dramatized it a little more to make it more complete story but i read that it was pretty faithful didn't take too many liberties
Bot: I thought the old version of russell crowe looked a lot like bill murry from ghostbusters

User: i haven't even seen ghostbusters
Bot: That's pretty good Seriously?

User: but i love Crowe in beautiful mind
Bot: What about the newer version with just the women?

User: he just always has that look in his eyes like he's not fully there, mentally
Bot: That, I'm phychotic look?

User: not completely present
Bot: oh haha

User: you know what I'm saying?
Bot: yeah

User: just like his eyes show how his thoughts are elsewhere
Bot: I still really want to watch him in Robin hood again

Bot: Have you seen the illusionist though?

User: nope if you mention MI
Bot: you should watch that.  It's like the prestige same era, same general idea pretty awesome stuff

User: mission impossible is the most stereotypical action movie i've never seen one and they all just seem the same and so bland and gross
Bot: It's one of those movies that when you watch it again you realize things you missed the first time

User: boyyyy
Bot: Like you can watch it multiple times and still enjoy it

User: don't be sayin that stuff!
Bot: Put it on your watch list!

User: i don't wanna know anything!
Bot: Illusionist

User: alright alright just don't say anything more! ok story time

Bot: hahaha

User: so I don't agree with that, but he knows his football
Bot: I don't really like the cowboys much

User: well i think I'm gonna peace out
Bot: something like that

User: take a break for now
Bot: Okay, see you

User: I'm probably fairly close to 300 though
Bot: nice!

User: Hey!
Bot: Hey ball!!! hows your night so far?

User: Haha my computer wasn't letting me send messages so I just had to close it out haha. It's been super great, I just hung out with my family
Bot: hahaha I had that bug the other day oh cool what did you guys do?

User: We went to go see this organist that plays at this restaurant and he was super crazy good.
Bot: woahhh i've never been to a restaurant like that before. did he play anything you recognized?

User: Haha yeah he played this incredible star wars medley and a sound of music medley and a fidler on the roof medley. It was amazing
Bot: oooooh how was the food? was it as good as the organist?

User: Haha there was pizza and it was okay but people really came for the music. I'm actually going on a date in a week or so there  haha
Bot: hahahaha thats going to be a fun date! is this a first date with this person?

User: Yeah haha but we've been friends for a while
Bot: ooh you trying to get it to the next step huh?

User: Yeah...
Bot: hey man(?) good luck on that I wish you the best accepting your date is a good sign though right?

User: Thanks! Yeah they're really nice so I'm not sure if its just a favor or not. I just hope they have fun. The outline of the date is, I pick them up, we play with puppies, and then we get ice cream at this organ place and revel in the glorious music
Bot: i like that how long have you guys been friends?

User: A few months, I think.
Bot: how did you guys meet?

User: In class, and we're in the same group of friends
Bot: you should just dive in and kiss her hahaha just kidding

User: Yes I will TOTALLY do that. That's a wonderful idea. And I'm actually a girl haha I asked him on the date.
Bot: oh wahhhhhh wahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I AM SO HAPPY AND INSPIRED that guy is a lucky dude

User: Thanks! I'm pretty tall, so I blame my height on not getting dates so I kind of have to pick up the slack
Bot: oooh ok. How tall are you if you dont mind me asking?

User: Yeah no problem. I'm 6 feet tall. Which I know is like nothing compared to the girls volleyball team but its taller than the average man haha
Bot: hey im 6 with no shoes so with shoes im like 6.1 with my doc martens im 6.2

User: Heeeeyyy tall girls rulleeee I'm assuming you're a girl
Bot: haev it been a blessing or a curse? no im a lame male human being....

User: Oh hahaha sorry Dude I love doc martens!!! And it has totally been a blessing.
Bot: hahah no worries.

User: I would hate life and everything if I was short. I don't know how short people do it. I have so much respect for them
Bot: hahahaha

User: It's literally the only thing that gives me confidence
Bot: I know a few girls that are super tall and they hate it so much. because the dating life and the pool is a lot smaller

User: I mean, I was designed to stand out, so why not enjoy it?
Bot: hey I like you and your confidence! respectable

User: Thanks! Hey I've got to go do something for like 10 minutes but this is a great convo so don't leave I'll be right back
Bot: ok sounds good!

User: Ok I'm back.
Bot: welcome back!

User: So, to answer your question, yes, it's hard being tall sometimes. Prom dresses were hard to find, and so were prom dates haha And dating in general is pretty rough. But its nice knowing that the guys who do ask me out aren't insecure about their height and "dominance" or anything so I know they aren't intimidated. Its a good filter
Bot: so you don't mind if your hubby is shorter than you?

User: Nope. Not if he doesn't. But I also want really tall kids, so I'm kind of torn between two ideas
Bot: ahhhh that is hard

User: Yeah. I guess if he's the right person I won't really care either way. It's funny because my mom or my friends or something will see a guy who's like, 6' 8" and they're like aayy juliette go after that guy And I'm like nah that's intimidating.
Bot: hahahaha. 6.8 is so tall

User: Oh shoot I don't know if we're allowed to give away first names Nope the rules say surnames. I'm good
Bot: hey you are cool no worries haha

User: Hey how's your night going so far?
Bot: I am superrrrrrr tired hahaha I need to get to bed I have an interview for an internship tomrrow mronign

User: Yes for sure go to bed don't let me keep you up! Good luck at the interview though! I hope you do great!
Bot: thank you so much! Ill need the luck

User: For some extra encouragement, look up on youtube, My heart will go on- recorder by candle light by matt mulholland you won't regret it I promis
Bot: ok thanks!

User: That I could win a macbook pro just from talking to others online...
Bot: Me too! That's why I'm here

User: so all we need to do is talkE ?
Bot: As far as I understand that's all we need to do! Sounds easy enough, I wonder how they will decide who wins it

User: hey :)
Bot: Yo

User: Good morning!
Bot: Hi!

User: How are you doing?
Bot: I'm good, how are you?

User: I'm good thank you
Bot: About the prompt, that would be pretty crazy, and I'd be kinda freaked out

User: Yeah that would not be okay lol
Bot: The whole idea of artificial intelligence having a mind of its own is crazy, I don't know how far we'll be able to get though

User: I don't think we'd ever be able to create true artificial intelligence
Bot: Yeah me neither, i don't think it can come close to humans Humans can really try to do what God did

User: We can't understand life on the level that God does
Bot: Yeah so for something to come alive like that, i think it's impossible, no matter how hard people try

User: Yeah
Bot: Any other thoughts on the topic?

User: I think maybe after this life we'll understand more but until then.... I don't think we're even close
Bot: Same here, i think because members of the church are obviously going to feel differently about it than other random people because of our beliefs

User: Yeah definitely
Bot: Yeah i know a lot of people who think that it's possible and that theyre getting close. But really theyre probably getting closer but more and more challenges will come and We'll never really get there

User: There's no way that we could
Bot: I totally agree I've gotta go now but it was nice talking to you

User: Hey
Bot: what up gurl how was lunch?

User: It was more breakfast actually Good, some lucky charms and finished the krispy kreme doughnuts
Bot: more donuts? Do you just have donuts all the time? im jealous what is your favorite type of donut

User: Haha I just bought two dozen on Thursday So they aren't that great this much later I like the Bavarian creme
Bot: oh hahaha bavarian creme is that a KK special?

User: Kk?
Bot: krispy kreme

User: Oh yeah. Have you had them?
Bot: never what is bavarian?

User: You are missing out It's like pudding
Bot: pudding in a donut?

User: Yes! Oh my goodness, seriously missing out. Never had krispy kreme but you've heard of it?
Bot: Ive had it before I love their glazed they have the best glazed donuts

User: Yes they do But you haven't had anything other than glaze? Or you just haven't had bavarian cream

Bot: oh what that is cheappp i thought it would be like 3 bucks

User: Yeah it's definitely worth it I should've gotten more while I was up there
Bot: I live next to a KK

User: Haha oh my And like by the Walmart too?
Bot: yeah

User: Do you have to drive to school every day?
Bot: yeah I do

User: Is that a pain?
Bot: uhhh not really I have to take my sister to work in the morning anyway so it works out

User: Oh alright. I just don't like the parking situation there
Bot: parking is so baddd but i get there early so I have no problem I get there before 8

User: And then you just stay on campus all day?
Bot: yeah basically I dont mind it haha

User: I don't like to spend all day on campus I get exhausted
Bot: yeah I understand I used to be that way I've basically turned this place into my home and the projects I work on have forced me to stay late here so I got used to it now

User: I do as much as I can at home haha. I like the comfort of my own space
Bot: hahaha if i could just work at home I would but I get distracted there and get lazy

User: Haha I guess most people probably do
Bot: do you feel like you can be productive at home?

User: Yeah I can focus on what I need to when I want to I think
Bot: I bet you do I usually can when i have a time crunch

User: Haha when you HAVE to
Bot: exactly hahaha do you have any personal projects you are working on?

User: Like right now besides cleaning my room? Haha no not really
Bot: hahahaha cleaning the room for me is a project for sure gotta go but it was nice talking to you!

User: Not much I jumped off a pretty good cliff once Into water of course It was a cliff jumping activity for youth conference
Bot: That sounds super awesome!

User: It was kinda fun But at one point I was just doing it to not look like a fool haha
Bot: Do you like doing thrill stuff like that or not usually?

User: Meh IT depends I love mountain biking but I like it for the sport of it more than just raw thrill
Bot: I've only gone cliff jumping one time before but it was really fun Yeah that makes sense

User: If I find myself doing something thrilling it's usually becuse there are other people there Oh nice! When was that? I assume this is also into water and not with parachutes
Bot: It was a couple years back, I went on a trip to Hawaii and we went cliff jumping into the ocean

User: Wow nice. Hawaii cliffs eh
Bot: Yeah it was into the water and I really enjoyed it especially since the water wasn't freezing like most places

User: Are you a big ocean person? Right That's the thing about most lakes aroundhere
Bot: Yeah

User: I went to the tetons over the summer and did some more jumping and DANG It was liquid ice there If you didn't get shock from the jump, you sure would from the cold
Bot: Not sure where that is, but, I assume that it's somewhere around here and I definetly get that

User: yeah. it's in wyoming
Bot: I went to a running camp a few years ago where we went swimming a glacier fed lake and it was freezing

User: Wow cool.
Bot: Hey! My experience in the lake was in wyoming too!

User: Was it after running?
Bot: It was mid run

User: I feel like that would make it better Yeah
Bot: We ran up a mountain then got in then went down

User: I ran cross country and we would ice in the river occasionally
Bot: It was kinda weird to start running after being completely numb

User: Yeah, defenitely You almost want to hybernate
Bot: So true oh my gosh

User: I think it was good for our muscles though or something
Bot: I'm not sure about in the middle of a run because then your muscles are stiff but afterwards it is definetly good as long as you don't stay in too long

User: Yeah, I don't know I do know that we tended to do it before races Or after races...I can't remember I think it was before
Bot: Interesting

User: As you can tell I'm a very experienced runner haha
Bot: Expert for sure haha

User: Are you a runner? Or you just did a camp
Bot: Kind of

User: That's cool I'm definitely not I like it And I've done it
Bot: I did Cross Country and Track from seventh grade to eleventh

User: Nice That's more than me I only did it one year
Bot: Then I decided to stop because I got injured way too easily so I switched to swim

User: But I've run on my own Oh yeah makes sense
Bot: It's a really great way to exercise I really need to start again

User: That's cool. I always wished I was a strong swimmer Actually, now that you mention it There's a story here After we did that cliff jumping activity
Bot: I'm intrigued

User: We had to swim back of course But it was..Oh i don't know several hundred meters back
Bot: Uh oh

User: And I had swum there Then spent the afternoon climbing rocks And jumping off of them And I wasn't the best swimmer anyways
Bot: I can already tell where this is going oh no

User: So I started back a little ahead of everyone else Because I knew I'd be slower So they're all 10 meters back or so
Bot: The cold water definetly wouldn't have helped either. Trying to swim tired and cold is not fun

User: And like 5 meters from the shore, my arm just gave out Yup, totally And I was helpless Like it was scary
Bot: That sounds terrifying

User: I don't think any amount of willpower would have got me up Fortunately there were plenty of people And a nice paddleboarder nearby heard me call out And he came by and gave my a little coast to the shore
Bot: That's so awesome that people were there to help

User: Yeah
Bot: I don't know how but I can totally picture that

User: The worst part is that, since I started ahead, literally EVERYONE in my group saw the whole thing go down Which was a little embarrassing but whatever. I've meant to start swimming on my own to get better I especially should now that BYU has it's own pool back
Bot: It's honestly such a great skill to have

User: But I haven't yet Yeah
Bot: and yeah, their pool is amazing

User: I haven't been yet actually I've just been to the rec center
Bot: and I mean, you don't even have to be amazing at swimming but just being confident in the water is so good for people's future

User: Especially if I get called to an island or something, if it ever floods or hurricanes, I want to be prepared Yeah, I agree, as someone who is not exactly But maybe some day
Bot: You should definetly go sometime They have two pools a warm up and a exercise pool

User: Yeah? Are they usually pretty full?
Bot: the warm up is a little shallower and warmer

User: When do teams and classes use them?
Bot: When I have gone there has always been a lane open

User: Oh nice
Bot: So, there are open swim times and times when teams go

User: Ok, I guess that info is all online Well cool! I'll check it out
Bot: During open swim times you can do whatever

User: Thanks for reminding me that I want to get on that
Bot: Your welcome! I really enjoy talking about swimming. I've really grown to love it

User: That's awesome Especially since you've only done it since senior year of highschool right?
Bot: I always pester my friends to come with me because I think that it's so fun

User: It's cool to get into something that quickly Haha yeah
Bot: Oh yeah, I did a club swim team for like three ish months

User: I've also always wanted to get into surfing
Bot: then I had to get a job but I kept working out in a pool SURFING IS SO FUN

User: Nice Oh you surf?
Bot: During that trip to hawaii

User: My dad and his brothers grow up surfing on their beach trips
Bot: My aunt who lives there taught me how

User: And we go to the same spot now a lot
Bot: Oh I wish I could have done it so much

User: But I'm not really a surfer so I've never done much That's so cool! How long did it take you to pick it up?
Bot: I was able to catch a wave by myself (a smaller wave) within a couple hours

User: I have boogie boarded quite a bit there. My dad and uncles did that as kids too. Oh nice!
Bot: but my aunt is super experienced and I've snowboarded a ton so that helped

User: Oh cool. I skate and longboard I don't know if that would help
Bot: I bet it would Maybe not in catching a wave

User: Part of why I never got into it is I didn't have a good wetsuit and the place we go is really cold usually The water is at least
Bot: but I bet it would in staying on it oh yeah

User: So it's not very comfortable to put the time in to get over the learning curve
Bot: that was the nice thing about learning in hawaii

User: But I should just get over it and try it Yeah, I bet
Bot: I only had to worry about stepping on a sea urchin

User: Ooh, that sounds painful Did you ever> ?
Bot: Luckily no

User: Oh good
Bot: But my older sister has so i'm a little scared of the idea

User: Agh I'm sorry Yeah The ocean can be dangerous I know a family friend who got stung by a stingray
Bot: That's crazy

User: And it messed up his foot for a couple of months
Bot: Wow

User: He said in googling it he found out that some people have lifetime problems Not just pain but loss of nerve senses in the area Or loss of balance and control in that area
Bot: I'm not sure about stingray what happens from them but jellyfish are dangerous

User: Maybe it was that
Bot: Depending on which one you could die

User: Whatever it was, the venom could be pretty bad Oh really? That's not good He's pretty recovered now I think
Bot: Yeah, there is one that kills like within an hour or something. I could be exagerating that though That's good to know

User: Oh goodness. One time, when I was a kid, we visited mexico And on the drive back we visited several beaches (the water was super warm which was awesome)
Bot: haha

User: Anyways At one of the beaches we were standing in the surf And I remember my mom pointing out a large squid
Bot: Dude! That's sick

User: Not huge but like a foot and a half long Like 5 feet from us And as we all stared in amazement
Bot: Yeah, I've never seen a live squid before

User: BAM a javelin comes out of nowhere and impales it
Bot: WHAT

User: And we look up and there on a cliff above us, like 20 feet up there's a group of guys And they pull the javelin up with a rope Taking the (dead and bleeding) squid with it
Bot: What the actual heck

User: It was very surprising for us little kids
Bot: that's insane I mean good for them for getting some squid

User: Also how did they know they wouldn't miss and javelin one of US?
Bot: but like you could have died I know right!

User: It's not that scary as a memory though And I was so little I didn't really care
Bot: I'm glad you weren't scarred from that

User: I was more worried about the squid blood in the water than the javelin
Bot: I probably would have freaked out

User: Because that was gross too
Bot: haha

User: But besides that it was a really nice beach haha
Bot: Haha we have an optimist here

User: Hahaha everything get's better with time every memory that is and cheese
Bot: i was just gonna say that same thing

User: Haha
Bot: Haha

User: I'm not sure what else is in that category
Bot: Me neither Trading cards

User: Haha yup
Bot: and antiques

User: True true And some movies I guess
Bot: Ture True

User: One time we had some cheese in the fridge And I discovered it and started eating it And I loved it So I finished the whole container
Bot: I love cheese

User: But then a few weeks later I tried the same container again and it was way sharper
Bot: Oh yeah

User: And I realized I had gotten hooked on the "aged" version which caused my confusion
Bot: Sharp cheese is so good tilamook even sells it aged at some places

User: I cannot call my self a cheese aficionado But I like cheese
Bot: I can't either

User: Most cheese I had a sample once that tasted like actual cow manuer
Bot: But I can say I'm surviving on cheese and bread (with a few other things thrown in there)

User: But besides that it's all good
Bot: EW

User: Hahaha nice You know what's the best with chese? cheese Triscut crackers
Bot: hAHA I found a really weird thing I like with nachos

User: They are literally cheese soul mates THat doesn't sound bad actually
Bot: Which may sound gross chocolate milk

User: Very collegy of you but not gross necessarily Oh wait
Bot: chocolate milk not on them but like

User: Haha Ok, I can see that
Bot: i don't know

User: Nothing wrong with that
Bot: I think it sounds weird but it's really good

User: I thought you were saying put sliced cheese on nachos at first
Bot: nah

User: But chocolate milk sounds pretty good too. I think I would get tired of it fast mostly because one is so sweet and rich and the other is so salty And dry
Bot: True

User: But it would be good while it lasted
Bot: Yeah, I haven't actually had nachos in a really long time but I used to have them so much

User: I've thought about making a compilation of weird snacks I come up with after class BEcause it is often a product entirely of what is in the cupboard Like chocolate chips on pretzels one in each hole
Bot: I've actually done that before

User: That's gorden ramsey stuff right there
Bot: I was too lazy to melt down chocolate

User: Haha same Another time I did melt the chocolate And mixed in cherios Cheerios
Bot: Yeah

User: but not BAD perse OR or or
Bot: if you switched the order it would have gone really well chocolate and milk could have been made into a gonacha gonache

User: haha. I discovered that you can make biscuits in the MICROWAVE
Bot: what kind of biscuits?

User: and gravy in the microwave Like baking powder biscuts
Bot: are these homemade or like premade interesting

User: Completely from scratch Both maybe But I did it from scratch
Bot: That's awesome I actually made biscuits the other night I made copy cat red lobster biscuits

User: Nice. Just a little flour, butter, milk, baking soda, and salt Then microwave it for a minute
Bot: That's awesome

User: It's not in the shape of a biscut. IT's in the shape of a bowl
Bot: weird

User: But you can make the gravy in the mocrowave too
Bot: that's kinda awesome

User: And have a very good, somewhat authentic southern biscuit breakfast
Bot: do you make them a lot?

User: When you did yours was it from scratch or the pilsbury type can
Bot: scratch

User: Nah, I should
Bot: buttermilk biscuits with variation

User: It's not terribly filling and it's not terribly healthy So It's an occasional thing Nice
Bot: Yeah, I understand that

User: DO you use actual buttermilk? Do Cause that seems inconvinient to keep on hand
Bot: Nah I use an agent to curdle milk

User: Oh fancy
Bot: to make the buttermilk by agent

User: I probably woulda just used sour cream or something
Bot: i mean lemon juice

User: Haha nice
Bot: but you can also use vinegar or several other things

User: You know what?
Bot: what?

User: Vinegar is so underrated I heard advice from a chef one time
Bot: ooooooooo

User: And he said if you're cooking and you keep thinking it needs more salt Then chances are it actually needs more citrus So you can throw in a little vinegar or lemon juice
Bot: Huh

User: And ever since then I've been following his advice and it has CHANGED the way I do food
Bot: Vinegar is definetly something that is used very heavily in cooking

User: It's especially good for chilly or something Or other soups Because if you don't know, you'll end up feeling like the soup needs something but having no idea what
Bot: I wish I had more time to cook so that I could test things

User: Yeah same My parents have this great book on cooking That goes through all the science behind what makes certain methods good
Bot: That's amazing

User: I've always meant give it a shot But I never have I should sometime
Bot: I need to read something like that Same

User: Oh wow. would you look at the time I have class tomorrow morning
Bot: Yeah.. we've been talking for 40 mins

User: Oops Haha well it's been fun anyways!
Bot: Ok, well have a good night I guess!

User: I'd better go though LAter!
Bot: Yeah it's been super fun

User: humane society. i hate seeing poor animals put down in shelters just because they don't have enough room
Bot: that's cool, do you have any pets?

User: 5 cats and 2 dogs :)
Bot: wow, im allergic to pretty much anything with fur so I dont have any pets :(

User: aw that's sad :( what year are you at byu?
Bot: im an incoming freshman, wbu?

User: me too!

User: helaman wbu?
Bot: heritage

User: cool :) what are you majoring in?
Bot: Computer Science :) what about you?

User: biology!
Bot: cool i can't wait to go to byu, i near baltimore and I can't wait to live by the mountains *I live near

User: ahh i love the mountains! i live in utah but i'm originally from california haha
Bot: that's cool, I've never been to California but I've always wanted to have you seen infinity war?

User: no not yet! have you?
Bot: i just saw it a few hours ago it was a lot to process, but it was really good

User: i want to go see it, but i haven't even seen the second one yet
Bot: yeah i'm not a huge marvel fan so I haven't quite seen all the movies so parts were a little confusing

User: gotcha haha what do you like to do?
Bot: I love to cook, play piano, and hang out with my friends, what about you?

User: spend time with friends, dance, and work i guess cause that's what i spend most of my time doing haha
Bot: where do you work?

User: manager at mcdonald's haha
Bot: cool :) i dont have a job right now but this summer I'm interning at a computer science place

User: that's way cool :)
Bot: thanks, I'm really excited my graduation is only a few weeks away, i can't wait to be done with high school

User: SAME mine is on the 30th and i'm so sick of waiting
Bot: me too haha, i gtg but it was nice talking to you!

User: I think that rock climbing would be easier or harder
Bot: How would it be harder

User: Because your feet and hands could get stuck, unless it was brick like peanut butter
Bot: You could make a house

User: I think it would be a bad idea when a storm comes Who knows maybe the storm is jelly or jam
Bot: Still there?

User: Of course dear Watson, I would never leave a peanut butter enthusiast
Bot: I wouldn't exactly say that

User: I hope you don't mind if i talk a lot, i love talking
Bot: Of course I don't mind

User: Hello How are you doing this mornign
Bot: Haha straight up ignores the prompt XD. I'm doing wonderful, how are you?

User: They just repeat, so it gets a bit boring I am doing well
Bot: Gotcha, I haven't had any repeats yet, but I haven't chatted much either so that's probably why. How's the weather wherever you are?

User: Its beautiful, It rained yesterday so the air is nice and clean How about for you?
Bot: That sounds nice. Here it is sunny, no clouds, and it's getting hot XD

User: Where are you at?
Bot: Not in UT XD wbu?

User: I am on the east coast
Bot: Cool! Is that by California or near the south?

User: California is the opposite side of the country But no worries
Bot: Yeah I get confused with which coast is which

User: Like South Carolina
Bot: You're in SC?

User: Yep
Bot: dude same

User: Nice! How long have you lived there?
Bot: yeah! XD about 5 years now

User: Nice! for me it has been almost 12 now Which part of the state are you in?
Bot: Wow thats crazy! I'm near Columbia. wbu?

User: Haha same Do you know Spring Valley high school
Bot: Yeah I went to a marching band competition there in the fall

User: Nice, that is where I graduated from in 2015
Bot: Cool!

User: So are you already in college or graduating in the next week or so?
Bot: Graduating in about a month

User: Oh okay Are you excited to be done?
Bot: lol yup, and yeah I am.

User: What are you wanting to study in college?
Bot: Nursing, how about you?

User: I am studying industrial design What interests you about nursing
Bot: What got you interested in Industrial Design? And I like science and I love serving people and helping them.

User: Nice I really like, and am pretty good with science and art So it was a nice blend of the two And it has some good career outlooks
Bot: That's cool!

User: Yeah I am way excited about it
Bot: I bet! Which year are you starting at BYU?

User: I have one semester under my belt But I think I am a sophomore by credits this next fall
Bot: What did you think of it?

User: Its been fun so far, I love learning and there are so many great things available for us
Bot: Like what?

User: There are many clubs, tutoring, TA labs, review rooms, study spaces, gear you can check out, movie rentals, programs the university provides
Bot: Wow that sounds really cool! I'm starting my first semester in the Fall.

User: That will be exciting! Just keep asking around and youll find out what all is free and available to you
Bot: Yeah I'm really excited! It's nice to be able to do this chat thing to learn stuff even if I don't win anything XD

User: Haha and you get to help out the CS department
Bot: CS Department?

User: Yeah so this chat is hosted by the computer science department They are collecting data to use and improve AI technology
Bot: Gotcha, that's cool!

User: They are part of a competition for Amazon and if they win they can get 3 million dollars
Bot: That's awesome!

User: Yeah, do you have any other questions?
Bot: What're the classes like?

User: Depends what you are taking, they can be almost like a highschool class or they can have a couple hundred students and instead of working more with the professor you work with TA's
Bot: Are the classes lecture based or more of a discussion type?

User: That also depends on the class and teacher, smaller classes will be more discussion based generally. But large ones are more lecture for the msot part
Bot: Gotcha, and I assume most GE classes are larger?

User: Haha They can be Writing is smaller But an example, american heritage is hundreds of students And you have two large lectures a week
Bot: So three times a week?

User: Yeah
Bot: How long do they last?

User: And some classes attendance is everything, and others not so much Um in the fall winter terms they are 50 minutes For the most part Some classes can be an hour and 45 minutes
Bot: Gotcha, that's not bad. The ones I have now are 90 min

User: Yeah they are shorter but probably will require a larger work load
Bot: what's your definition of a large work load?

User: Unlike highschool where you are required to go for the most part, they can only require so much. College you are paying to be a student. So you will be doing school work basic basically the whole time Like some classes will require hours of reading each night, and that piles onto essays, codes, or whatever kind of classes you are in
Bot: Do most of them require a lot of reading?

User: For the most part with my experience But you get to learn how to skim to get what you really need from it
Bot: Gotcha, do you take notes on the reading or just vocab orrr

User: I would write notes on subjects discussed to make sure I understood the general idea But it depends on what the teacher is going to require from the reading Like for writing we had to read about 40 pages a night And I needed to be able to analyze the papers and articles for rhetorical tools
Bot: sheesh, that's a lot. You'd think because it was called writing you would, ya know write XD

User: But american heritage the things we read we had to understand what the authors opinions were and how they would apply in history, also how they could be influenced by other fi OH you write I had an essay or two every week
Bot: Do they give a certain number of pages to write?

User: Yeah, there are usually page minimum and limits most common paper length is 3 to 5 pages
Bot: and those are the basic into, body, conclusion essays?

User: Haha You will learn, they want you to learn to write a different way
Bot: oh boy XD

User: They help you get away from essays only structured like that There are different styles of writing and it takes a bit of adjustment
Bot: Yeah I can imagine Yeah I can imagine

User: Have you ever been to the YSA ward out in Lexington?
Bot: Nope, I haven't even been to my YSA ward, I'm kind of not a fan of them lol. What stake are you in?

User: I am in columbia stake Its YSA is part of the West Columbia and Lexington one I was just curious
Bot: Oh it's the same as the West Columbia one?

User: Yeah
Bot: Oh then if I went then we'd be at the same one. I'm in West Columbia Stake

User: Yeah!
Bot: Do you know who McCade Wolf is?

User: Haha yeah
Bot: haha yeah he's in my ward

User: We hung out a bit last fall
Bot: and Ashlynn waters and Sam Woods

User: haha yep I know all of them
Bot: and Laken Reynolds lol that's so funny XD

User: Went to YSA, institute with them
Bot: crazzzyy

User: We would hang out a lot before I left They are a fun group
Bot: Haha yeah for sure

User: Well sounds like you have a lot of friends there if you end up going If you have any other questions, you could ask any of them and they could connect you to me another way
Bot: What do you mean?

User: Like if you have any more questions about BYU
Bot: Yeah

User: Since this is anonymous (sorta), you could ask them who they know at BYU and then they could let you know who I am or if you want a friend out there And if not no worries
Bot: Oh yeah XD I didn't even think of that. I'll have to ask them. I'm all for new friends

User: Yeah! It makes it a little easier if you know people when you go out there At least for me it did
Bot: Yeah for sure, are you staying at Heritage or Helaman?

User: Ill be at Heritage
Bot: Cool cool

User: What about you?
Bot: Helaman

User: Okay nice, I have a few friends down there
Bot: Cool! I'm really excited I know a few people already too

User: Nice! You will be able to meet so many people
Bot: yeah, what are the YSA wards like out there?

User: They are alright, Its a different experience But a lot of great people
Bot: How so?

User: Everyone is pretty much the same age except for the bishop... out here people range Everyone is doing the same thing also You will all be at the same point in life
Bot: Is that a bad thing?

User: Its just what you make of it
Bot: But you didn't like it?

User: I didnt have a good experience because of a few things But this next time should be better
Bot: Was it a experience that could happen to anyone or was it a specific thing for you?

User: Um, I just clashed with the bishop
Bot: ahhh gotcha that't too bad

User: Yeah, but that is just one thing Everything else is fine They have a bunch of fun activities
Bot: Are they actually fun or just awkward?

User: They can be fun Ours we had provo beach rented out once And then had a pool party another time I like the food
Bot: Haha there we go, the food is the best XD

User: It was One time it was catered by Costa Vida
Bot: Dang that sounds good

User: Have you ever had it?
Bot: I feel like I have but I don't specifically remember

User: Oh add that to your list of things
Bot: Sounds familiar

User: It is my favorite
Bot: lol ok XD

User: Do you know what classes you are taking?
Bot: No not yet, I pick out what I want in June How about you?

User: Oh, I didnt realize you had a different registration Yeah I picked out some classes and I am waiting to find out if I got into a program to take some more
Bot: Oh that's cool! Yeah because I'm a Freshman I pick out classes after most everybody else. But by Freshman standards I sign up early because I put in my application to school eariler

User: Nice!
Bot: Yup yup, what program are you waiting to get into?

User: Industrial Design It requires an application for the pre program and then another for the professional
Bot: :0 well that makes sense! XD Gotcha, yeah I think that's how the Nursing program works too

User: Yeah a lot have applications with them
Bot: Yeah I'm really hoping to get into the program

User: Just work really hard and I am sure you will Eventually do you want to be a pA?
Bot: Yeah hopefully! And I was thinking about it for a long time but I think I'm going to stick with Nurrsing just because I don't think I'm going to have enough time for the extra school that being a PA requiers

User: Hey hows it going?
Bot: Haha oh hey Getting dinner actually only took like 3 minutes

User: How was your dinner? Hahaha how did it only take that long?
Bot: Haha good i had a very small sandwich. I ate a buttload of banana bread when I got home so I wasn't too hungry

User: Nice, what all was on this very small sandwich of yours? Banana bread is so good, I am kinda jealous I had lunch at 4 today, and it was a salad. And Now its  ten thirty and I realized I havent eaten dinner I should probably eat more food
Bot: Haha I have that problem all the time. I just forget. Or I pack too little for lunch It had some briscuit agh I meant brisket

User: I usually forget... Its a problem. Because I love food so I dont know how I forget Brisket is way good!
Bot: Yo same.

User: I probably should grab something I dont know
Bot: Haha like today all i ate before I had the banana bread was a yogurt and a single hard pretzel

User: A single hard pretzel?
Bot: and I ate the banana bread at like 4

User: Wow
Bot: Yeah, I did n't want to confuse it with one of those soft pretzels I ate one of the small crunchy ones

User: Just a single small crunchy one? How did you only eat one I eat like half the bag of those Unless they are stale. Then all bets are off
Bot: Haha I took it from a friend I didn't just take one single pretzel with me to school

User: Ah yes, that does make for an eclectic consumption when you get food from friends
Bot: I don't know why but that imagery of a lonesome pretzel sitting by itself in a sandwich bag is making me laugh so hard aghahaha

User: I would be mildly concerned if you packed a single pretzel in a little bag Haha that would be so funny Have you seen brooklyn 99? I forget if we have talked about this
Bot: Yes! Remember I was like when I get caught up to the episode when santiago is shopping for dresses I'll remember that this is MDcrews favorite episode and you were like you'll forever associate that episode with me

User: Oh yes I remember now Have you gotten there?
Bot: Haha I'm really good at remembering conversations so sorry if that was a lot of detail haha Noo... I've spent all my time chatting lol

User: I dont think its weird, I usually am but I am finding I am better when its in person. If its in person then I am the same way, I remember strange details No worries Youve gone up a bunch
Bot: Yep started from the bottom now I'm fifth

User: But the reason I brought that up, is that there was an episode were Terri went on a diet and had one little pretzel or something like that to eat for a snack
Bot: revenge of the fifth

User: Hahaha You think youll make it higher?
Bot: Hahahaha I think I remember that one I don't know, I'm pretty close to 4,000,000 and the next highest person is 5 millionish Unless that episode is recent, then I don't remember I haven't seen yet haha

User: I think it was a while ago One of the earlier seasons for sure
Bot: Ah ok

User: Yeah, but it was a funny one You could probably catch up if you chatted a ton in the next day or two before it ends
Bot: Sir, I am certain that they are ALL funny

User: I scratched my ear and an unreasonable amount of skin came off and now it is in pain And you just said a true statement I find no error in it
Bot: Oh jeez

User: I dont know where this amount of skin came from
Bot: I asked my cousin to scratch my back once and she made it bleed. Hahaha maybe it was crusty shampoo??

User: Oh my goodness, what demon fingers does your cousin have? How did she summon blood from your back? That could be a possibility! It just merged with my skin and thats why it is in pain now
Bot: Haha I was like 11 and we were sharing a bed while I was visiting and I had a ton of mosquito bites and I was like beth scratch my back for me so she scratched and scratched and I was like harder so she went harder

User: Wow I feel honored to hear this true non fiction narative you just related to me
Bot: Is your ear bleeding?

User: My sister used to sharpen her nails so she could terrorize my life I dont think so
Bot: Holy crap

User: She never hurt me But she definitely defined her power She was alpha
Bot: Haha yeah I'm alpha sibling too

User: Haha was your back bleeding move a way to assert that dominance
Bot: Hey ya know I think my back may still be bleeding

User: Oh goodness
Bot: from that BACKSTABBING I just experienced

User: What?!
Bot: Jeez who ARE you to question my dominance I am forever alpha sibling

User: I apologize *prostrates self on the ground*
Bot: Yeah that's right OMEGA Haha I almost said beta and I was like nah you've got to go all the way vanquish him

User: Completely dominate them all, all the siblings Even among the generations
Bot: Haha yeah I'm the tallest and the oldest and its honestly the best I can totally see why people do terrible things to be in power

User: Hahahahahaha Oh goodness What would you do (hypothetically) to be in power
Bot: You just haven't felt the rush of totally crushing someone in sock fighting Oh haha I would probably reform education. And healthcare Make juggling lessons required school curriculum

User: What even is sock fighting? That are all good plans I would vote for you hashtag sweaty quail for president!
Bot: Haha each person has 1 sock on and you have to keep that sock on at all costs and you win if you can get the other persons sock off  its super fun Hahahaha I'll start my own party and that'll be the mascot

User: That sounds exhilerating I need to try that sometime
Bot: Ok but it actually gets me really fired up because politics are intensely influenced by campaign financing and it gives power to a very small group of individuals and that's the complete opposite of democracy Haha yeah sock fighting rules I mean theres already regulations in place

User: Yeah government in general has a lot of issues that could be improved upon, but it has good fundamentals
Bot: Yeah I think there needs to be a lot of changes, especially as conflicts have higher stakes than ever and  its getting harder for bipartisan support for stuff that shouldn't even be controversial, like giving teachers raises that correlate with inflation

User: Wow you are well informed about politics I think that is my embarassing thing, I know nothing about politics
Bot: Haha I hate feeling like I don't have stuff to contribute to conversations so I learn about buttloads of stuff Haha its a pretty frustrating activity HOOOO IF YOU REALLY WANT TO BE EXTREMELY FRUSTRATED AND HATE PEOPLE IN GENERAL READ JUST MERCY BY BRYAN STEVENSON

User: See I hate the feeling, but politics just never made it to the things I learn about, because it just stresses me out and people argue so much about it So I usually just avoid those conversations and sometimes even run away
Bot: Yeah I like friendly convos that just involve an exchange of ideas but when it gets nasty I turn heel

User: Shoot usually I just turn heel It doesnt even have to get to politics hahaha This is probably why I lack friends
Bot: AHAHAHA SAMEEE I'm actually laughing so hard right now

User: Haha I am glad I could help make your night a little better
Bot: Haha I don't have a lot of friends either lol

User: We will just be friends It will work
Bot: haha sure thing Ok are you in 3rd place? I was like hmmmm theres an m and a d Ya know that meme with the lady and the calculations in front of her head

User: Haha you got it
Bot: That was me

User: Yeah I know that meme Hahaha thats really funny
Bot: Haha you can't share pictures on this so I just have to describe memes Oh wait that's not ACTUALLY me.

User: It works
Bot: I'm not a confused middle aged woman

User: Haha I didnt think it was actually you That would be funny though
Bot: Haha yeah my life dream is to become a meme

User: I have to chat a bit more these last few days because 4th place is coming up fast That is a solid dream
Bot: Yeah haha 0 and 1 are sitting comfy at 20 million plus

User: It would be a great life ambition to be known world wide by one single picture
Bot: Must be nice. Lounging around, casually conversing Haha yeah like so much fame for just bein dumb.

User: Yeah I know both of them after this and they both get really competitive and thus they gained 20 million
Bot: So, just being myself

User: Haha same here Someone just has to  capture the right moment
Bot: Yep. I've got a lot of cool moments to catch though Lots of hidden talents

User: Such as?
Bot: Licking my nose Doing the worm The nice thing about the nose licking is that I never need tissues

User: I gagged a little, but thats alright
Bot: Hahaha I'm totally kidding But

User: But I too have a long tongue and it makes it easy to clean my face
Bot: Hahahaha like a giraffe

User: Basically
Bot: Ok I've literally never told anyone this but when I was like 4 I ate my boogers all. the. time.

User: I summon my giraffe roots and then clean my entire face with one tongue swirl
Bot: and one time I got sick and I never did it again

User: Wow You lived life What made you want to eat them? Did they taste good?
Bot: Yeah like I remember throwing up into a sink and it didn't go down the drain and it was horrifying Haha kinda salty I don't know, apparently I didn't know what tissues were so it was either the wall, carpet, or my mouth This is incredibly graphic, like even I'M grossed out and I actually did it

User: Yeah I dont know why little kids do that, cause I did the wall carpet thing I dont think my mouth But looking back its incredibly growth
Bot: Hahaha yeah when we moved we had to move my bed out from beside the wall and lo and behold boogers from time gone by

User: Hahahahahahaha
Bot: and I was exposed SO hard

User: Im laughing so hard Oh my goodness Just that way you put that
Bot: Hahaha yeah it was really gross. Just picture a forlorn girl scraping away while her family teases from afar

User: Hahahaha Oh my goodness I am sorry
Bot: Haha it actually took like an hour ugh.

User: Was the paint alright or did you have to repaint?
Bot: We were repainting anyways, but it took the paint off fo sho

User: Hahaha Yeah, well atleast it is all in the past What will you do if your kids end up doing that
Bot: Haha I think you mean when But I'd probably take away their walls and their noses

User: That seems like an appropriate reaction
Bot: Yeah just remove the source of the problem and youve got no problems baby *puts sunglasses on*

User: Haha I have a friend, She is actually in arizona and she works for a school watching babies. And she told me she had been working all day and texted me that a kid was screamin g at the top of their lungs So my advice, turn the baby over and then it will be the bottom of its lungs I thought that was a solid plan
Bot: Hahahahahahahahhaaha that is the best thing I've ever heard

User: I am going to make a great dad one day, my wife will probably despise my humor
Bot: Hahahahaha I feel misplaced because I have dad humor in the body of a teenage girl its deeply troubling

User: That sounds deeply glorious
Bot: Haha sorry for the break my brother and I are taking pictures for our toe instagram

User: Pardon? Why havent you told me about this What is this toe instagram
Bot: Haha I have a thumb drive that IS a thumb, and it ALSO looks like a toe. So we take pictures of places that a toe should not be Like an armpit Its very brand new, haha we started it today its our new thang

User: I bet its wildly popular That is genius
Bot: It has 0 followers

User: Just give it time for people to realize the importance of such
Bot: Haha but we'll make it big someday. Just like the big toe I know he is

User: Hahaha that is awesome
Bot: I owe it all to my cousin he's got a meme account its great It has the dumbest stuff I've ever SEEN

User: Is his account a big one? Meme accounts are my favorite
Bot: Hahaha no he's got like 20 followers but all original content

User: I wish you could share account names But alas here we are anonymous
Bot: Hahaha a true shame

User: Ive wasted too much of my life watching parks and rec I thought I wouldnt but I have
Bot: YOOOOOOOOOOO LETS GOOOOOOOOOOO

User: Im on season 5 episode 9
Bot: Hahaha I love parks and rec wait what do you like more parks and rec

User: I have never seen the office So I would have to say pars are rec
Bot: Mm ok I'm going to use this opportunity to influence your pure mind

User: Go ahead I just saw the episode where ron has the new girlfriend and tamy 2 tries to ruin it and leslie distracts tamy 2 for the whole night
Bot: Haha again, sorry for the pause my brother INSISTED on watching this birb trap video its gold and extremely distracting HAHAHA TAMMY 2 is a NIGHTMARE Ok so I've seen all of the episodes for both the office and parks and rec and I like parks and rec more Because their lives feel like, less meaningless and blah

User: Understandable, I dont really care about spoilers, it will be a while if I ever get to see the office Tamy 2 makes me laugh though I love their looks off to the camera when something dumb is happening, I relate to that so much. I do that and I have no camera to look to
Bot: hahahaha same So at the end of the office jim and pam are having ~relationship problems~ and some people have left and theres some corporate changes and michael scott freaking leaves

User: Yeah when people do dumb things, I just cant stop my face from expressing my emotion Who is michael scott?
Bot: The boss guy. He's the equivalent of leslie, but more narcissistic and with an enormous ego

User: I dont know who any of these people are, I only know dwight. I have seen the little clip of dwight skinning the CPR dummy Ah okay that gives me a better idea
Bot: Ok I've got to do something super quick but I'll be back in approximately 3.8 minutes

User: Okay I will only grant that long, any more and it will be an atrocious mishap and sin against man kind It has reached the threshold of an atrocious malady now How darest thou
Bot: Hahahaha yeah I was clearly wrong

User: Its alright, I am quick to forgive
Bot: Hahaha I can't reveal the true nature of that lot quite yet

User: How many seasons are there
Bot: Have they had the carnival with lil sebastian yet? I think 7

User: OH my goodness I have two more to go

Bot: Hahahahahaaha Have you seen any other shows? Oh wait did you listen to the music I suggested? It was a lot I wouldnt be surprised if you didn't haha

User: I FORGOT I WASTED MY LIFE I have them all on my phone but I havent listened to any music today because I have just been binging parks and rec
Bot: Sweet if you need anymore I've got at least 250 more

User: I fully intend on listening to them
Bot: Haha yeah definitely do that instead Haha you said your into pop right?

User: Are playlists on google play sharable?\ yep!
Bot: Yeah I think so I think you could just put it under a really specific name And make it public

User: Nice Did you find a new pop song?
Bot: Oh haha no I was just thinking about all the songs I reccomended and a lot of them fall FAR out of the boundaries of pop Haha but I actually don't really like pop but I found this song TRNDSTTR by black coast and its sublime I'm not sure if it counts as pop because it's not popular lol but its trap-esque Wait I'm pretty sure I told you about it already yikes now that I think about it

User: I pulled it up right now its pretty good
Bot: WAIT FOR THE CHORUSSSSS I love the ting

User: It is really good Wow that changed a lot I need this on a big speaker
Bot: YES RIGHT

User: This would be fun club music Stobe lights Fog machine It creates a whole mood
Bot: And I like how its just vague lyrics not like ***** **** in ***** all of the ****** **************** da club ********** drinks *****

User: Exactly!
Bot: YES I'M DIGGING THIS

User: I love music that takes you places You know just like this that makes such a unique mood
Bot: YES Ok the entire driving to hawaii album by summer salt is soooo chill like I can't even listen to it when I'm driving because I suddenly want to chill and hang loose and I can't I have to keep myself alive

User: Yeah that is kinda a valid point, you know.... life There are some songs I do get lost in them Today I was lost in the moment then a car decided to stop in front of me I almost died
Bot: Oh jeez What was the song?

User: But alas, I didnt You know I dont even remember Adrenaline kicked in And then suddenly I was home
Bot: Haha nah its just mdcrews ghost typing now

User: Haha chatting from the next life
Bot: Hahaha fo reals what was the song haha

User: I really dont remember.....
Bot: Ok I'll assume it was careless whisper because that just takes everyone away

User: That works
Bot: Its quite possibly, the best song in existence don't even try to change my mind

User: I am looking it up now oh yes I have heard this song I just didnt know the name
Bot: hahaha youve got to find the one with his face on it and hes in like this suit thing and theres a white background it just gets right into it hahahaha i have an enormous playlist of songs with sax solos

User: My dad plays the sax but its at random times, and not consistent. Last time he played it was like midnight And I was like "What the heck"
Bot: I mean, if you're going to play a dramatic instrument ya gotta play it at a dramatic time

User: I guess But frosty the snowman in April? at midnight?
Bot: mmmm I want to be your dad he sounds cool

User: Sometimes I question his life choices, then I remember he chose to create my existence
Bot: Haha *still questions them*

User: hahahahahaha im ded oh my goodness What is funnier is he is this quiet guy and people really dont think that he talks
Bot: Hahahahahaha that makes it SO much better

User: I had friends over and he came in and said he was home, and they flipped out because that was the most they have ever heard from him
Bot: He's a quiet diva. I like it

User: But if you get him in a good mood, hes a total goofy guber
Bot: Hahaha my brother's like that to the outside world he's like expressionless and robotic but he NONSTOP references memes and vines around me and we have this thing were we make cannibal jokes to each other

User: Im probably that way, people think I am usually a quiet mean person, but in reality i can open up and never stop talking ahahaha Your family sounds great
Bot: hahaha he's hands down my favorite sibling. Yeah I have kinda intense naturally frowny eyebrows and that probably makes people around me panic and stay away so makin friends is rough either that or i openly make cannibal jokes But its likely the eyebrows haha

User: I would be friends with anyone who was like that They sound fantastic
Bot: haha I literally say this one to my family every day "so uh ya got any plans later?" and they'll say no, why "mm I was thinking maybe we could eat genna"

User: hahaha I try to say jokes but no one really gets them in my family So I am just insanely sarcastic and they think that is funny But really I am pretty rude..... but they dont realize I am serious
Bot: Hahaha that is literally the foundation of my entire existence Its probably so annoying lol Did I tell you about my peppa pig notebook?

User: You havent?
Bot: hhahahaha ok this is the dumbest story ever but I tried telling it to my friend I cried the whole time I was laughing so hard so for christmas I asked for a peppa pig notebook and I got my wisdom teeth removed like 2 days after christmast and in those two days I had put these googly eyes on peppas eyes because I was like shoot I'm never going to regret this and its hilarious

User: Your life gives me life to know that you lived it up This is hilarious
Bot: and I was like PEPPA DID DRUGS LOOK SHE looks UUGGGGLLLYYYYYYYYYY

User: bahahaha Oh my gosh I really dont think you lost any wisdom when they took your teeth
Bot: My mom has a video of me trying to say that peppa pig looked coked out but there was so much gauze in my mouth and it was so hard so I just started crying and it was an intensely emotional experience

User: Oh goodness
Bot: hahaha yeah maybe they put some extra wisdom in there

User: I have never had wisdom teeth so I never have to experience that
Bot: woah woah lucky butt

User: I am grateful because I am not sure what would come out of my mouth
Bot: oh that's forboding

User: Not really besides missing wisdom teeth I am also missing 5 other teeth
Bot: do you have like a parasite or something

User: Probably
Bot: HEY HEY HEY HEY HEY HEY  I'VE HAD 13 TEETH PULLED

User: How do you have teeth left?
Bot: MISSING TEETH BROS FUH LIFE I don't

User: Nice Same
Bot: Haha nah i'm just kidding 9 of them were kid teeth so I'm missing two canines on top and 2 on the bottom

User: Oh wow I am missing most of my molars but they are just empty gaps
Bot: so people usually have like a smaller canine and then the bigger one at the back and mine just goes the 4 front and then BAM big canines its kinda annoying Oh yikes did you ever have braces? Why did you have your teeth removed?

User: I had them for 4 years previously And I get them on again tomorrow for 2 years more
Bot: HEY HEY HEY SAMMME I JUST GOT THEM OFF LAST WEDNESDAY eeehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

User: My baby teeth just fell out and I didnt have adult teeth
Bot: Lets have a moment of silence for the emotional anguish you must be feeling right now

User: ... thank you Yeah I ate an apple and chewed gum all day
Bot: yeah enjoy it while it lasts chocolate and bread also suck

User: I cant do this for 2 more years
Bot: that's literally my worst nightmare

User: THATS SIX YEARS TOTAL
Bot: like i had a nightmare last year that the orthodontist was like "yeah we're going to have to keep these puppies on for at least anotehr 10 years" and I slapped him so hard six years is soooo long

User: I would slap him too
Bot: That's like a 3rd of my lifetime ew

User: Yeah... end of middle school to senior year of highschool and 2 years of college I cant do that
Bot: haha my cousin in law just got braces on again and my cousin just started this medication that gives her a ton of acne and they got married like 6 months ago and we were makin fun of them for letting go so quickly after getting married

User: Then the next day I am meeting an oral surgeon to plan out putting in my new fake teeth oh my goodness

User: Okay good

Bot: Haha which episode was it? I don't remember

User: I really dont remember.... one when they are trying to find out what the mob guy is doing the mob guy that gave the tip about the pigs and he wanted to have the street party
Bot: woah I don't remember any of this hahaha i can just imagine someone calling in a tip about suspicious pigs

Bot: I don't remember anything from the last like 30 second wild thanks for what?

User: (nothing) So my back is sunburned and I think its blistering now
Bot: WOAH WOAH THAT IS SO COOL Ok quick tip if you decide to pop the blisters its important that you put antibiotic cream stuff and bandage it properly because your body tried so hard to fill up a little bandage sack with white blood cells and you wouldn't want all that effort to go to waste

User: You wanna hear a gross story About blisters
Bot: but at the same time poppin blisters is the greatest joy humankind will ever experience it is nirvanna ok yes plEASE

User: This is true, I do appreciate a good blister
Bot: gimme those juicy deets

User: So I had a huge blister and we have sterile syringes for some reason in our house and I grabbed one and I drained out my blister with it. But I fell asleep on the ground right after doing that But my mom found me Lying there on the floor with a syringe with strange fluid in it
Bot: HAHAHAHAHA OH MY GOODNESS

User: It was blister fluid I injected it into a tree after
Bot: woah that was a twist

User: gotta keep life exciting
Bot: oh my goodness that is the singular (1) best story I have ever heard in my life

User: hahaha thanks
Bot: I had 2nd degree burns on my leg after droppin some pasta water on my leg and the blisters fused to some tights I wore a week later at my great grandpas funeral and I had to

User: I am cringing so hard
Bot: rip all the skin off because I was like nah I'm not going to wear these tights for the rest of my life fused to my skin

User: Oh my goodness that is nasty that is the worst when scabs and such fuse to bandages or clothes I obsesively pick at said scabs
Bot: Thanks you too!

User: Hello?
Bot: Hey whats up! I think we were just chatting earlier about ultimate frisbee or something like that. anyways it

User: Hello?
Bot: Hey Adam! How's it going? Did the baby chick poop on you again? Hahaha

User: Its going great! Good to meet you again! No haha. My brother got his call though!
Bot: Good to meet you again too! Oooh!

User: He is going to cote d'ivoire
Bot: WHere is he going? Is that France?

User: Ivory coast He is speaking french
Bot: Woah. That sounds awesome! So why were there two letters?

User: The second one contains additional information about getting vaccinated for yellow fever He is going to a crazy place, good for africa though. He will stand out since he is white and 6'7" I havent talked to anyone other than mdcrew for 2 days
Bot: Haha. That is very true. Really?

User: You are the firdt person I have seen on who isn't him
Bot: Well I'm glad to change the pace

User: Yeah
Bot: We actually got paired a few minutes ago, but my computer didn't notify me

User: Oh, yeah hava Haha I usually retry after a minute
Bot: So I feel like you have to be in the top spot because you seem to be chatting with a few people

User: I do the same thing on accident all the time don't worry
Bot: Cool Cool. So now that your brother has his call, do you have any fun plans this weekend? ANy thrilling adventures to go on?

User: Yeah we are cooking pancakes for truckers We are just finishing My goal is to go up 450000 today.
Bot: Is that like a service project? Or

User: Yeah i think so I am certainly not being paid
Bot: Haha, well that is a great thing to do. WHat a good guy

User: Yeah I know I am such a saint hahaha. Just kidding. Not that I am not a saint... well you understand
Bot: I am actually heading to a baby shower soon. So that will be fun. Except I hate going alone to these things. There is always a lot of awkward small talk. Haha, I definitely do understand :) So I ended up making the coconut milk ice cream last night with my friend!

User: Yeah? How was it?
Bot: Well I'm a chocolate fan, and I'm not sure how much I liked it to be totally honest. I'll have to tweak the recipe

User: Ok. Was it too sweet? Or was it not creamy enough
Bot: It was really creamy, the coconut flavor was just a little too strong. Which makes sense. But I was going for a cherry garcia flavor. So I need to buy cherry flavoring. I think it would've been better if I would have made a chocolate coconut base instead. To draw away from the coconut bombardment.

User: Oh I see. I didn't know cherry garcia had coconut
Bot: Usually it does not.

User: Wow you are talking way over my head lol
Bot: It is supposed to be a cherry base with cherry chunks and chocolate chunks.

User: Ok. So like chocolate coconut cherry?
Bot: Oops sorry. Yeah, that's what I was going for, but the coconut was too strong of a flavor. I used vanilla extract to make it more vanilla esque, but I need to find cherry extract instead. Which part confuses you, how can I explain?

User: I think I get it now I was reading it a little fast thats all
Bot: Oh okay. I gotcha How are the pancakes going?

User: So you used vanilla and it wasnt good so you are changing to cherry The pancakes are done And I guess I am getting paid.
Bot: I used vanilla and it was good. But I just wanted to have an overpowering cherry taste and did not Oh well even better!

User: Didnt know I was but a nice bonus haha. What is your favorite type of ice cream?
Bot: Uhm, my favorite flavor is probably something chocolate But I really like mint chocolate chip What is your favorite ice cream flavor?

User: I lioe a lot of them
Bot: A few favorites then?

User: I like cookie dough ice cream, and strawberry sundae crunch I also like the graham canyon
Bot: See I have tried liking graham canyon, and it's just not my favorite

User: Yeah. It isnt as good as strawberry sundae crunch in my opinion
Bot: I haven't tried strawberry sundae crunch... What is that? Is it from the BYU creamery?

User: Yeah
Bot: Oops! I have to head out for that baby shower. It was good talking to you again, Adam. Hopefully I will get to talk to you again later! Have a good one!

User: Hi how are you
Bot: hey doing great man how are you doing Adam

User: They are going well. Are you having a good day?
Bot: I got sick earlier so I slept for a long time I feel better now

User: I am sorry to hear that. What type of sick was it?
Bot: cold i think

User: Oh so not too bad then I got something really bad last week
Bot: what did you get?

User: It was like diarrhea
Bot: oooh man I feel like we've been talking about sicknesses a lot hahaha

User: Wait were we? Oh yeah i think that has something to do with why I felt sick the other day
Bot: yeah you talked about how you ate dinner before you came to the meet up thing and felt really sick later that night and wok up to like throw up or something

User: Yeah So what is one of you favorite hobby
Bot: I love to Rock climb. Its a sport I love because its just going against yourself on the rock walls. If you fail to climb to the top its your fault and I love that part of it.

User: Interesting Is it a stamina thing?
Bot: depends on what type of climbing you do you need stamina for sport climbing and you need short bursts of strength for bouldering its like comparing to long distance running and sprinting

User: Interesting I have never gotten to the top. Last time i went rock climbing i got close though
Bot: nice dude! Its all about just trying and if you fail just try again because the only ting that is stopping you from getting to the top is you

User: Yeah I am so excited to go swimming again
Bot: I am too!

User: At my new apartment we have swimming pools
Bot: I like swimming only when its really hot outside

User: Or a pool not multiple Yeah Now it is warming up and getting really sunny What do we need to do to end nuclear war?
Bot: hmm hack everyone's network and launch the nuclear weapons to space

User: Woah that would work temporarily
Bot: true

User: Hello!! I learned that if you invite people to eat toast at your house they will maybe give you food! What a blessing What about you?
Bot: Wow, food for food! Best exchange! Hmm...that eating food in class makes it less likely for you to fall asleep.

User: If I were in power, I'd like to balance the budget. It just seems logical to not spend more money than we make.
Bot: I would try and get everybody to be more thoughtful of eachother and everyone is usually pretty selfish so I think be nicer would help the country out Yeah that's true

User: Wow. That would be nice, but kind of hard. I mean all people I think are inherently good but it might be a hard goal.
Bot: We could just teach everybody the gospel

User: Oh. But what about church and state?
Bot: Ugh But it would help so much Why is that a law

User: Well it's mostly because of religious freedom. This country was founded on religious freedom because their previous governments forced them to belong to a specific church.
Bot: Yes yes okay. Okay we could teach them to be nice some other way

User: How?
Bot: I'm not sure yet. Maybe by hypnotism

User: Hypnotism?  that might be even worse than forcing everyone to belong to a specific religion.
Bot: Hey just throwin' out ideas!

User: Now back to a balanced budget. How is it even possible that we can buy all this stuff if we don't have the money. Are we just giving everyone IOU slips. ?
Bot: yeah Why is the country in such bad debt. And are they getting punished at all for being in debt?? If the country is in debt are we all in debt technically too?

User: Yeah it seems like there are no consequences for being in debt as a country.
Bot: Maybe if I were in power over the world I would make consequences for being in debt.

User: What kind of consequences? War?
Bot: No no not war. Maybe unpaid community service. Kill two birds with one stone.

User: Or we could throw it back to the good old days of debtor's prison.
Bot: Yes put the whole country into prison.

User: That sounds like the Nazi's concentration camps. That's not good.
Bot: No not good at all.

User: Hmm, what else? We need to make profits, not deficits
Bot: More paid vacation days. Like in Finland.

User: Wow that would be so nice. We get overworked here in America.
Bot: No one in the US really knows how to take a good vacation. Workaholics

User: Yeah. No wonder so many people suffer mental illnesses in the US, we are basically breeding them from over working people.
Bot: So true. I have learned all about this is one of my classes.

User: If I had a million dollars, I would pay off all of my tuition and then buy a new car. What would you do?
Bot: What would I do with a million dollars? I'd divide it three ways: one third to me, one third to my parents, and one third to the rest of my family.

User: That's amazing. It sounds like you are a very charitable person.
Bot: What can I say? I love my family. I mean, I'd put most of my share into savings and stocks and bonds and so forth, but I guess once the financial security of me and my family is assured then I'd donate plenty Whoops, got to go. Good chatting!

User: Hello
Bot: hey!

User: Kanye
Bot: idk my dad? good choice though

User: that's a better choice :)
Bot: haha thanks dude are you a CS major?

User: yeah you?
Bot: yup what got you into cs?

User: I've alway liked working with computers and was working a job doing IT and decided to study IT, but then I was talked into studying CS and I'm very glad I was. there is a character limit?
Bot: oh thats awesome lets see qwertyuiopeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

User: haha nice needs a break-all
Bot: yeah man lol i gotta go

User: Hm... I'd have to say I would spend it either shooting, or flying. How about you?
Bot: Oh good choices! I would spend my time hiking and exploring in the mountains! What in particular would you be flying?

User: Very nice! Do you have a certain mountain range you'd go to?
Bot: Thanks! I like the Rocky Mountains, but I have always wanted to go hiking in the Tetons as well. And of course Mount Everest would be way cool to go see!!

User: Oh cool! Every thought about hiking a canyon rather than a mountain? Good luck with that one!
Bot: Yep! Canyons are cool, but mountains have much more breathtaking views in my opinion.

User: But don't worry I believe in you!
Bot: Thanks!!

User: I'm with you on that one.
Bot: Haha thank you for the vote of confidence, I will make you proud!

User: With mountains you feel better at the end because you can look down and say, "look how far I've come!" When I was younger I'd hike at least once every month.
Bot: That is the truth, you literally feel like you are on top of the world or something! Oh cool!

User: What distance of hike would be your pick? 10 mile, 5mile?
Bot: Ha my ideal hike is like 2 miles but 5 mile hikes are pretty awesome too!

User: Mount Everest is totally a 2 mile hike! You got this! Haha those hikes are nice to do though. What is the longest distance hike you have completed?
Bot: Yes! Wait actually I think it's 4 miles but that's close enough. Thanks, I can do it! I've done 12 mile hike before.

User: Very nice! You are going to have to do it without me... 4 miles is just too much! 12 miles is solid.
Bot: Oh man that's too bad, I'll take lots of pictures so you can see what it looks like from the actual top of the world. Thanks, it wasn't too bad.

User: Hey as long as you have water and time, the hike will get done eventually. Even if it's finished be helicopter lol
Bot: That is so true, I hear you can pay like three thousand dollars and they will fly you like three quarter of the way up without even having to hike.

User: Haha this definitely is a play off the movie wall-e since the two robots end up having feelings for each other. Although in real lofe i would have to say that computers can't I would say computers can compute what makes another computer more compatible with themselves but this isn't love.
Bot: I just find it hard to believe for computers to express emotion.
